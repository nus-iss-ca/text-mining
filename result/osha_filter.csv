202651907, Crane Operator Incurs Knee Injury When Crane Tips Over , At 10:30 p.m. on January 9  2013  Employee #1  a crane operator employed by  Concrete General Inc.  along with Coworker #1  a rigger  and Coworker #2  a  laborer  were using a mobile crane as part of a bridge repair project. The  crane was a boom truck that was being operated in a closed 11-foot lane  the  fast lane  on one of two bridges  the westbound bridge. Employee #1 operated  the crane without the outriggers extended and with only the jacks down. This  was because the single lane closure did not allow sufficient space to extend  the 17-foot outriggers. The crane was being used to remove the temporary work  platform located on the inside of the bridge. The needle beams were being  removed from under the work platform and were being loaded onto a flatbed  truck that was parked behind the crane. Each beam weighed 1 796 pounds and  measured 21 feet in length. Employee #1 lifted four beams with the crane. He  was removing the fifth beam when that beam started swinging. Employee #1 lost  control of the load and the crane. The crane tipped over and the boom landed  on the eastbound bridge. Employee #1 sustained a knee injury.

Maryland OSHA's investigation  determined that the crane collapsed between the 50-foot span of the two  bridges  above the creek that ran 60 feet below. At the time of the collapse   the crane's hydraulic boom was extended to 58 feet and the boom angle was 65  feet. The load chart requires that the boom angle be at a maximum of 45 feet  with the boom extended to 58 feet. Therefore  the crane was being operated  outside the safe parameters required by the manufacturer's load charts.  Employee #1 and his two coworkers were exposed to struck-by hazards while  working with the mobile crane.

201112737, Employee Burned When Vapors Ignite , At approximately 3:00 p.m. on May 8  2000  Employee #1  a leadman for a  waterproofing contractor  was working at an apartment building in Hollywood   CA. He was using an electric chipping gun on a raised portion of the concrete  floor after the walls and floor had been cleaned with acetone. A flash fire  broke out and Employee #1 suffered first- and second-degree burns to his face   forearms  and hands.                                                            
201402831, Employees Injured During Explosion , Employee #1 was part of a two man crew working at a house removing linoleum  tile. The room that crew was working in did not have heat so they brought a  heater and a fan to warm up the area. They were using acetone on the tile when  an explosion occurred. Employee #1 suffered burns to his body and was  hospitalized.                                                                   
202545240, Employee Is Caught By Fallen Trellis  Suffers Fractures , At about 3:00 p.m. on July 9  2013   Employee #1  a foreman with Razmik  Tarkhanian Dba Bridge Iron  was securing a 22 ft wide by 65 ft long trellis  between two buildings that were under construction. Employee #1 was working  alone  removing safety brackets  with an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene)  from  the column supporting the trellis. The trellis brackets were about 18 ft above  the ground. Employee #1 noticed that the steel tube connecting the trellis to  the northwest column was not straight. Employee #1 was the foreman responsible  for safety and the proper installation of the trellis at the site. Employee #1  decided that the welded connection at the northwest column was unacceptable  and had to be repaired. Employee #1 used an acetylene torch (oxy-acetylene) to  cut the bottom weld on the steel tube connecting the trellis to the northwest  column. When the bottom weld was cut  the weight of the trellis was too great  for the remaining welds to support the 15 000 pound structural steel trellis.  This action allowed the northwest corner of the trellis to fall approximately  two ft and trap Employee #1 between the trellis and the wall. Apparently  the  structural design of the structure was modified by an unqualified foreman   when he removed structural welds. This caused the remaining welds to fail  under the load  and allow the structure to fall. Employee #1 was transported  to the hospital  and he was admitted for over 24 hours  for chest and facial  fractures.

Dba Bakersfield Well & Pump Company  began  cutting a pipe with an oxygen-acetylene torch after he removed the cap from  the well casing and marked the cut line. He was cutting the well casing to  raise it for the pump pad. Then  a piece of slag fell in excess of 30 ft down  into the well casing  igniting an unknown substance. This caused flames to  rise to the top of the well. Employee #1 was leaning over the open well casing  when flames hit him in the arms  neck and chest area. Employee #1 received  flash burns to the face  neck  anterior torso and bilateral upper extremities.  The well was not properly tested with a gas monitor prior to cutting the well  casing. Employee #1 was not wearing the appropriate personal protective  equipment (a long sleeve shirt (cotton or FRC)); (leathers and welding  gloves). Employee #1 was hospitalized.

When they  removed the main support beam of the roof  the northern section of roof  collapsed. One truss of the southern roof portion remained attached to the  main support beam and was bent approximately 6 feet of the truss down toward  the ground. The owner then decided they should stop for the day and left the  immediate area to park the bobcat skid loader in another portion of the  building; however  Employee #1 continued to work while the owner was out of  the area. The owner walked back to the area where the work was being  conducted  and he heard an oxygen acetylene torch running. He felt the  building vibrate and heard a large crash. The owner arrived in the area and  found Employee #1 under a pile of concrete and mortar. The debris came from a  portion of the wall in the work area. Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  where he was pronounced dead.

One sign had a catwalk on which  Employee #1 and his employee were working. The sign with the catwalk toppled  onto the adjacent sign  pinning both workers. A third worker  who did not  witness the accident  summoned emergency responders to extricate both workers.  Employee #1 was killed. The other employee was airlifted to a hospital in Fort  Worth for unspecified injuries. Windy weather conditions and the weight of the  two workers may have contributed to the incident.                               
102269925, Employee Is Injured In Aerial Lift Collapse , At approximately 10:45 a.m. on September 19  2009  Employee #1 was operating  an Eagle 44 towable boom lift (Serial Number 17901) at an approximate height  of 32 ft to remove signs located outside of a retail store. When the lower  boom's hydraulic cylinder apparently failed  the boom fell to the ground.  Witnesses indicated that Employee #1 was ejected from the basket and then  restrained by his fall protection equipment. He was hospitalized at Renown  Medical Hospital for severe injuries to his face  fractured ribs  and a  fractured vertebra.

He was pulling on a painting spray hose so it  would reach the work area when he struck the power line and was electrocuted.  A coworker rushed to help him and Emergency Services was called. The Fire  Department responded and transported Employee #1 to the hospital  where he was  pronounced dead. He had been using proper fall protection equipment and had  received basic safety training  but nothing related to the hazards associated  with overhead power lines. His employer had been in the trade for more than 10  years and should have been knowledgeable about the safety requirements for  working around power lines  but it had not scheduled any special provisions  for this job site. The employer had apparently acknowledged the power lines  once he was on the job site and positioned the truck at the opposite end  but  Employee #1  who was in his third week with the company  was directly over the  line at the time of the accident.                                               
201353208, Employee Is Killed In Fall From Billboard Catwalk , On August 22  2006  Employee #1 and a coworker were working from a catwalk to  dismantle an aluminum tri-wave sign from a billboard. Both Employee #1 and his  coworker were wearing personal fall protection harnesses and lanyards. There  was a cable installed near the catwalk on which they were standing for their  lanyards to attach. However  Employee #1 did not attach his lanyard to the  cable. After removing a number of aluminum pieces from the sign  Employee #1  and his coworker bundled them together so that they could be lowered to the  ground with a rope. As they lowered the bundle of aluminum to the ground   Employee #1 slipped and fell about 35 feet to a paved parking lot. He landed  head first and was killed.

After initially cutting five (eight ft) sections  near the top of the tree  Employee #1 raised the lift and attached a rope line  halfway up the branch. Three other coworkers were below on the ground and were  holding onto the line  in an effort to control the fall of the branch.  Employee #1 positioned the lift near the lowest crotch  while the coworker  using the chain saw made several cuts at the base of the approximately 30 ft  branch. Instead of falling away from the aerial lift bucket and toward the  three employees who were pulling on the rope  the branch fell towards Employee  #1 and the coworker  who were in the aerial lift bucket. The coworker in the  bucket was able to move out of the way of the falling branch  which then  struck Employee #1 in the back of the head  striking his forehead against the  top rail of the aerial lift bucket. Employee #1 sustained blunt force trauma  head injuries. Paramedics responded and declared that Employee #1 was dead at  the scene.

The crew consisted of a supervisor  the owner of the company  and  two other employees that were working together to demo the building. The group  had cut the top of four out of the five southwestern most main support beams  earlier that day with no issues. They moved to the northwestern beams and  began cutting the top of four out of five beams  but could not get the I-beam  piece out. After breaking a new 0.625 in. diameter choker  they tried to  extract the piece out  but could not. It was then decided by the owner   supervisor and Employee #1 to cut the bottom of the beam to get the roof to  collapse. Employee #1 made the pre-cuts (cutting the beam  but not cutting all  the way through the beam)  and then he went to the ground in the aerial lift  to get a choker and shackles to attach the lower piece of the beam to the arm  of the Hi-Lo machine that was located on the south end of the building. Once  elevated back to the beam that was pre-cut  Employee #1 attached the shackles  and choker to the arm of the Hi-Lo machine and the cut beam. Employee #1 made  the final cuts to the beam. Employee #1 started down in the aerial lift that  was located on the north end of the building. Instead of booming to the left  (away from the building) and then down  Employee #1 came straight down the  west side of the building. Every other time  Employee #1 had boomed away from  the building and then down according to the owner. As Employee #1 reached  approximately 80 ft above the ground  the roof above the I-beam collapsed. The  piece of the beam that was attached to the Hi-Lo arm swung out and hit  Employee #1 in the back of the neck area  pushing him against the controls of  the aerial lift. The owner of the company went to the lower controls of the  aerial lift and lowered the basket to the ground. By the time the basket was  on the ground  the plant nurses and first responders were on site and started  medical attention on Employee #1. Emergency medical personnel transported  Employee #1 to a county hospital. Employee #1 had received multiple blunt  force injuries to the head  neck  and chest and died at the hospital.

He was operating a scissor lift  a Skyjack SJ111-3219  Equipment No.  103319. He moved the lift to the area where he intended to run electrical  wires. After positioning the lift  he raised the lift's platform to reach the  conduit on the ceiling. Employee #1 pushed the electrical wires from the left  conduit to the right. After pushing the wires into the conduit  he needed to  move the lift forward and to his right to pull the electrical wires from the  other conduit. He was looking down from the top guardrail of the lift as he  reached for the lift's controller behind him with his right hand  to move the  lift forward. Employee #1 pushed the controller forward to drive the lift to  the right. However  the lift's platform rose up. Employee #1 realized the  toggle switch was on ""lift"" mode instead of a ""drive"" mode. He immediately  released the controller and tried to move the platform down  but it continued  to move up. Employee #1's face was caught between the lift's top guardrail and  an overhead pipe. Eventually  Employee #1 was able to bring the platform down.

He was hospitalized for approximately three  days. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the San Mateo Fire Department and  the Employer at approximately 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.  respectively  on July  18  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated its investigation at the work site at  approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 30  2013. Participating in the inspection  were Employee #1's foreman/supervisor  the project superintendent of the  general contractor  and the field operations manager of the general  contractor. The investigation revealed that Employee #1's employer had leased  the scissor lift from Sunstate Equipment since October 16  2012. The employer  returned the scissor lift to Sunstate Equipment on July 19  2013  the day  after Employee #1 was injured. While the equipment was in the employer's  possession  the lift's relay switch was replaced to correct a steering  problem  and the platform control box was replaced due to the lift's inability  to go up. Cal/OSHA did not issue an Accident-Related citation  because the  investigation determined that the cause was not a violation of Title 8   California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR). However  Cal/OSHA issued one General  Citation for the employer's failure to train and instruct its employee in the  proper use of Skyjack III 3219 Scissor Lift  in accordance with the  manufacturer's operating instructions  and Section 3203  Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  Section 3638(d).

The company was a heavy construction contractor  specializing in paving. It was working on a new taxiway at Los Angeles  International Airport  which had to be thick enough to support new jumbo jets.  The finished surface was to be nineteen inches thick. As part of the  preparation work  an old asphalt-covered taxiway was being demolished. The  area had been marked by ""Dig Alert"" to indicate buried electrical lines. There  were electrical vaults in front of the tractor about twenty yards away  to the  right of the tractor about 3 yards away  and behind the tractor about fifty  yards away. The asphalt had been marked in red where the wires entered and  exited the vaults  and on the asphalt in front of the tractor. There was no  marking  however  on the side of the vault to the operator's right to indicate  any lines entering it. The job being performed at the time of the accident was  ""potholing"" for soil samples to test for chemical contamination. Because the  lines entering the nearby vault had not been marked  the operator assumed  there were no cables where he was digging. As he dug  he contacted conductors  energized at 34.5 kilovolts approximately twelve inches below the surface. He  had been well trained  and as a result he stayed in the cab of his tractor  until emergency crews deenergized the conductors. This took approximately 3  hours. Employee #1 was not injured.                                             "

202455671, Employee Separating Panes Of Glass Is Burned By Alcohol , Employee #1 was working for Sierra Glass and Mirror Inc.  which installed  glass at residential and commercial sites. On the day of the accident   Employee #1 was using denatured alcohol to separate laminated glass. He had  been working at Sierra Glass and Mirror Inc for about eight years. He was  doing his regularly assigned work  and he had been working in this particular  work area for about 6 years. He was a manager. There were two stages to  separating the glass  and each stage consisted of pouring about 1.5 to 2  ounces of denatured alcohol onto the laminated glass. Employee #1 was working  on the second stage of separating the glass with denatured alcohol. It was  later determined that Employee #1 had not been formally trained on the health  and safety hazards of denatured alcohol  and any training he had received was  verbal or acquired through observation. Because denatured alcohol burned with  a clear flame  it was difficult to see if denatured alcohol had ignited.  Employee #1 had thought the first stage was done  and he had proceeded to the  second stage. At that point  he noticed a small flame on the can of denatured  alcohol that he was holding with his right hand. He tried to put out the  flames  but the can exploded in his right hand. The explosion caused injuries  to his right hand and the right-hand side of his torso. Employee #1 was  transported to Huntington Memorial Hospital and later transported to Los  Angeles County+USC Medical Center  where he had skin graft surgery to his  right upper arm and thorax  with skin that came from his right thigh. During  the investigation following the accident  the employer did not submit training  documents indicating that Employee #1 had been trained in the health and  safety hazards of chemicals  general safety of work  and so forth. Moreover   based on the lack of documentation  the conclusion was that Employee #1 was  not trained on how to safely work with denatured alcohol.

202659058, Worker Using Power Hand Drill Sustains Finger Amputation , At approximately 9:45 p.m. on December 18  2013  Employee #1  employed by The  M S Rouse Company  Inc.  was working at a building site. He was wearing rubber  gloves and using his personally-owned Dewalt 130 Volt  .5-inch VSR Drill to  mix Artex floor patch. The mixing paddle became loose. Employee #1 attempted  to reattach the paddle without first turning off power to the drill. As he  depressed the trigger of the drill with his right hand while holding the  paddle to the chuck with his left hand  his left little finger became  entangled in the drill. The tip of his left little finger was amputated.  Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  where his finger was treated. He was then discharged without  hospitalization. The employer's Chief Operating Officer reported this event to  Cal/OSHA at approximately 9:10 a.m. on December 19  2013. Cal/OSHA initiated  its onsite investigation on March 14  2014. The investigation established that  The M S Rouse Company is a privately owned company specializing in the  installation of commercial floor coverings. Employee #1 had been employed by  the employer as a journeyman floor installer for approximately four years.      
201130085, Foreman'S Finger Is Amputated When Unguarded Saw Kicks Back , At approximately 10:00 a.m. on December 11  2013  Employee #1  a carpenter  foreman employed by Pacific Peninsula Group  was performing interior carpentry  at a residential construction site. He was using a Bosch 4000 stand-mounted  benchtop table saw with a 10-inch blade to cut wood pieces for framing  modifications. As he was making the first rip cut to a section of laminated  wood product measuring approximately 16 inches long by 1.75 inches wide by 4  inches high  his left hand contacted the blade. His left hand and fingers were  severely cut. Emergency services were called  and the Mountain View Fire  Department responded. Employee #1 was transported to Stanford Hospital  where  he was admitted and treated. His left middle finger  which had been completely  severed past the first knuckle near the palm  was surgically reattached. The  left ring finger  which was severed through the bone past the first knuckle   also was reattached  but during a return hospital visit this finger required  surgical amputation. This event was timely reported to Cal/OSHA by the  employer  and also reported by the Mountain View Fire Department. In its  subsequent investigation  Cal/OSHA identified the employer as a construction  management company performing as a general contractor for this residential  apartment building project  with tasks being performed by its own employees as  well as subcontractors. The task Employee #1 was performing required two rip  cuts to the section of laminated wood product to achieve the desired finished  piece  because the blade was capable of rising only to approximately 3 inches  high. Employee #1 was working alone  and no witness to the event was  identified. The guard for the Bosch 4000 included a hood  a splitter  and an  anti-kickback device combined as a single unit. This guard/hood was at the  site  but Employee #1 stated the guard was not installed on the saw at the  time he began to plan and perform his cuts. Employee #1 stated he set the rip  fence to the right of the blade at approximately 1.25 inches and had no other  anti-kickback attachments  separate from the guard/hood  available to install.  He also stated he did not install any featherboards or jigs to use as he made  cuts without the use of the guard/hood. Employee #1 stated he was pushing and  guiding the wood through the blade  with his right hand positioned at the end  of the wood length nearest to him  and his left hand positioned on the top and  at the end of the wood farther away from him. He stated there was no push  block or push stick at the saw  and he did not make one to use. He stated that  the first cut was almost complete  and the blade was about to come out at the  back side of the wood piece  when the wood kicked back and shot past his right  side. He stated his left hand was extended behind and over the saw blade  before the cut  but was pulled back partially by the kick-back  or his hand  movement may have been reflexive. The result was that his left hand contacted  the blade. The investigation report included a comment that the guard   anti-kickback  and spreader features of the Bosch 4000 were not separable.  They were designed to extend above and past the blade of the saw and would not  have allowed the uncut portion of the wood piece to have passed. The first cut  of the employee's two-step cutting plan was similar to a dado or cut where the  blade does not extend through the top of the wood. The report concluded that  the type of rip cut Employee #1 was making was allowable without use of the  blade's guard/hood only when additional protective devices  such as  featherboards  were being used and separate anti-kickback devices had been  installed. No protective devices  such as featherboards or anti-kickback  attachments  were available or installed on the table saw during the time when  the saw's guard/hood was not in place. No push sticks or push blocks were  available during the time when the table saw was being used.  
202692299, Skilsaw Blade Jumps And Ampuates Carpenters Finger , On November 14  2013  Employee #1  a 33-year-old male journeyman carpenter  with Torre Reich Construction  was using a Skillsaw to cut 1 in. shims from a  2 in. by 4 in. board. As Employee #1 went to reposition the saw and start a  new cut  with the saw blade stopped  he reached down with his left hand to  pull the bottom guard back so he could place the blade directly against the  wood. As Employee #1 did this  he inadvertently squeezed the trigger with his  right hand as he lifted up on the saw. The saw blade started spinning and  caused the saw to jump. As the saw jumped  the spinning blade struck Employee  #1's left pinky and amputated the tip.                                          
202510194, Employee Amputates Finger While Cleaning Pump , On November 12  2013  Employee #1  a concrete pump operator with Maxicrete  Inc.  Dba Maxicrete  was cleaning the equipment (Putzmeister; Model Number:  TK-50 Mobile Concrete Pump) at the end of the day  using a garden hose. The  pump was energized and was under power to facilitate cleaning. Then  Employee  #1 turned off the machine  and he reached through the slot grate at the front  to remove a plug of hardened slurry from the feed at the bottom. When the feed  valve moved  it caught Employee #1's right hand fingers. When Employee #1  pulled back on his gloved hand  the tip of his middle finger came off.  Employee #1 was hospitalized.                                                   
202546438, Employee Partially Amputates Thumb With Circular Saw , At approximately 10:00 a.m. on November 7  2013  Employee #1 was working on  the construction site of a residential building.

Employee #1  was rip-cutting a board to create a notch in it. He was holding a 2 in. by 6  in. piece of lumber in his unsupported left hand  and holding the saw with  only his right hand. When Employee #1 made the rip cut into the lumber  the  saw rapidly jumped out of the cut  causing him to lose control of the saw. The  saw blade made contact with his left hand resulting in a partial amputation of  his left thumb. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center  where he was  treated for the partial amputation and was then hospitalized.                   
201262318, Employee Falls Demolishing Amusement Ride  Is Killed , Employee #1 was engaged in the demolition of a structural steel amusement ride  at a theme park.

They were engaged in forming work  hanging pilaster panels. Employee #1  was standing on an epoxy-coated dowel while anchored to a similar open-ended  dowel above him. As Coworker #1 passed him a sledgehammer  Employee #1 lost  his footing. Employee #1's restraint slid off the anchor  and he fell to the  concrete surface 5 to 6 feet below. Emergency services were called  and  Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated  for a fractured leg. The employer reported this injury to Cal/OSHA on  September 17  2013. The subsequent investigation determined that the employer  was a general engineering contractor involved in highway  street  and bridge  construction. Employee #1 was directly employed by the employer. The causal  factor in this event was that the anchor point used by Employee #1 was not  secure. It had an open end from which a worker's fall restraint device could  slide off.

He was treated  at the scene by emergency medical services  which transported him to a  hospital. He died from his injuries.                                            
201078680, Employee Falls From Decking And Is Killed , At approximately 2:35 p.m. on October 11  2012  Employee #1  a laborer  and a  coworker were covering an open-air atrium in a hospital with rolled poly  plastic sheeting. The hospital was undergoing renovations. The plastic sheet  was placed over the atrium to maintain negative pressure and prevent  construction dust from entering the nearby and connected VA Medical Center   which was an active location in the hospital. The open-air atrium measured  approximately 24 ft by 45 ft. Second floor and roof deck guardrails had  surrounded the top of the atrium  but had been demolished over the summer.  Additionally  DBI-Sala anchors that employees had used to demolish the  guardrail had been removed. After demolishing the guardrail  the top of the  atrium was enclosed by a locked construction fence. During a prejob meeting  that occurred at approximately 11:00 a.m. on October 11  2012  a crew attached  plastic poly sheeting under the existing sheeting drooping inside the  building. The crew used a scissor lift to attach this plastic to the inside  edge of a 2in by 4 ft wood frame around the atrium  instead of the second  floor and roof deck surrounding the edge of the atrium opening. Further  the  crew did not discuss what would be required for employees that access and work  from second floor and roof deck. Employee #1 and the coworker were instructed  to stay in the scissors lift and install the plastic from below. However  they  were not told that this was because no guardrails or approved fall protection  anchors were in the area around the atrium opening. When Employee #1  his  coworker and the rest of the crew were assembled to discuss the job  they  informed the foreman that the job could not be accomplished from below the  existing plastic using the scissors lifts. The foreman then directed the crew  to install the rolled poly plastic over the existing plastic and from the  second floor and roof deck. The foreman stated that he did not discuss or  receive permission for this change in the work procedure with the operations  manager. The site superintendent was also not aware of the change in the work  procedure. Further  the foreman and others had not been on the roof before the  work commenced. The foreman directed Employees #1 and a coworker to wear and  use fall protection. Employee #1 was wearing a Miller (Model Number E650) full  body harness with a Rebel Protecta 10 ft long retractable lanyard device  attached the harness. Employee #1 and the coworker pulled the plastic over the  open atrium  when Employee #1 fell. Even though Employee #1 was wearing fall  protection  his fall was not arrested due to the failure of the DBI-Sala  anchors. He fell approximately 20 ft from the roof atrium opening onto the  floor and was killed.                                                           
201078169, Dam Worker Ties, At approximately 9:50 a.m. on June 27  2012  Employee #1  a laborer  and  Coworker #1  a laborer and supervisor  both employed by Shimmick Construction  Co.  were working on the face of the San Vicente Dam. They were moving a  sprinkler system up and down a large metal form that contained recently poured  cement. The cement  which was to increase the height and depth of the dam  had  solidified after being kept in the metal form  and the sprinkler system was  being used to prevent the cement face of the dam from cracking during the  curing process. Employees working on the face of the dam surface use their  harness and lanyard to tie off to specific areas of this metal form when  performing certain activities on the dam. The metal form has only one area to  which employees may tie off. It is called the strong back  is one of the  vertical ribs in the back section of this large metal form  and is an  anchorage point capable of withstanding at least 5 000 pounds for each  employee. Employees are prohibited from tying off to the metal shoes which are  attached to the front of the form by a carter pin. However  Employee #1 tied  off to the metal shoe when he was moving the sprinkler system. He fell  along  with the metal shoe  approximately 40 feet down stairs near the bottom of the  dam. Employee #1's lanyard was still attached to the metal shoe when he was  found after his fall at the bottom of the dam. Employee #1 sustained a left  ankle fracture. He was transported to a hospital and required surgery during  several days' hospitalization. Cal/OSHA Division was notified at 10:45 a.m. on  June 27  2012  and initiated its investigation at the employer's office in  Lakeside  CA at approximately 7:50 a.m. on July 10  2012.

According Employee #1  he was  making his first trip up the ladder  using both hands  to install a screw eye  as an anchor point to tie off the ladder. When Employee #1 was approximately  14 ft above grade  the ladder became unstable and fell. A coworker saw  Employee #1 hanging onto the gutter momentarily  and then falling to an  asphalt surface. He was hospitalized at Stanford Hospital for a fractured  ankle  a fractured wrist and other injuries. Document review and employee  statements indicate that this was routine employer policy prior to the  incident. Employee #1 did not recall what may have caused the ladder to fall.  The employer's work practices for safe ladder use  including tie-off  were in  place during the inspection of the job site. Employee #1 stated that the  intended location for his anchor point did not require him to lean to either  side of the ladder. Employee #1 indicated he had inspected the ladder prior to  use and that it was not damaged and was placed on a level surface. The  superintendent on duty stated that the ladder was inspected after the fall and  there was no observable damage.

The lanes of travel  were approximately 12 ft wide  so the milling machine made two passes  since  it can only cut seven ft wide on each section to cover the entire lane.  Employee #1 was standing approximately three ft in the far inside lane on the  ground between milling machine and interior median wall inside of the approved  traffic control set up  and approximately midway up the machine and 17 ft from  the traffic control devices and flow of traffic. The milling machine was  approximately nine ft wide by 50 ft long  while operating. Employee #1 was  guarded by the machine from the flow of traffic. Approximately five to ten  minutes into the first pass  the milling machine operator noticed lights  hitting the reflectors on the inside wall and turned briefly to see a vehicle  coming. The operator thought it was the Project manager coming to check on the  status of the project. Then  the operator realized that the oncoming vehicle  was not equipped with a strobe  as required in work zones. The operator turned  and yelled for Employee # 1 to run for safety  as a Chevrolet Tahoe came down  the inside lane where Employee #1 was standing. The driver of the Tahoe  continued traveling in the far inside lane of the work zone  where Employee #1  was struck and thrown some 100 ft from where he was originally standing. The  vehicle was moving approximately 45 mph per hour. As he was transferred to a  hospital by emergency personnel  Employee #1 was treated for severe trauma   lacerations  fractures  and contusions to the body and head. Employee #1 was  pronounced dead at the hospital. The driver of the vehicle disregarded the  traffic control set up  all warning lights on the rear of the milling machine   and cone spacing of 100 ft. The construction work zone was set up correctly  with all signage  cone spacing  tapering  attenuators  and lighting; all of  the traffic control set up was approved by MUTCD for this type of tr

201128675, Employee'S Thumb Is Crushed By Equipment  Later Is Amputated , At approximately 12:50 p.m. on November 14  2011  Employee #1 and coworkers  were involved in a hydrostatic testing project  which required the excavation  of a street to remove and replace faulty high-pressure valves. A request was  given to retrieve an end shore jack in the excavation site. Employee #1 choked  a lifting strap around the middle of the end shore jack  where a hook on a  backhoe was to be connected. A coworker operated the backhoe. As Employee #1  positioned the hook on the strap  the backhoe operator moved the hoist up   which suddenly jerked the hook and the strap upward. Employee #1's left thumb  was caught between the hook and the strap  amputating the tip of his thumb.  The backhoe operator reported that he could not clearly see Employee #1;  however  other employees stated otherwise. Further  one of the employees  stated that Employee #1 was standing on the pipe above the jack being removed   so the top of his head was at the street level. After the incident  Employee  #1 was transported to a medical center  where he underwent procedures for  finger amputation and was hospitalized for postoperative care.                  
200881811, Fall From Communication Antennae Tower Hospitalizes Three , On October 25  2010  three male construction workers (ages ranging 31-51) were  riding the load line of a hoist while in the process of installing a new  antennae on a communication tower. The mast that the upper block was attached  to catastrophically failed  plunging the three workers (Employees #1  #2  and  #3) 20-30 ft. to the ground.

202489019, Employee Severely Injures Hand When Caught In Winch Hook , On May 19  2009  Employee #1 may have inadvertently installed the winch cable  hook to the safety cable as opposed to the transition plate of the hoist  cables where it should have been attached. Because this equipment was being  attached inside a light pole  most of the installation was accomplished  through touch because visibility was limited. Since the safety cable was also  attached to the transition plate  Employee #1 may have thought the winch hook  was properly installed and holding the hoist cables. Later  when he reached  into the light pole to release the winch hook from where he thought it was  attached  it slid down the safety cable under sufficient tension and severely  injured the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand. Employee #1 was  transported to a medical center  where he underwent treatment  including  amputations of the severely injured fingers and was released.                   
202539086, Employee Suffers Contusions In Fall From Beam ," At approximately 1:06 p.m. on January 21  2008  Employee #1 was working at the  construction site of a new  four-story steel-framed parking structure in Los  Angeles  CA. At the time of the accident  the construction was at the second  level. Employee #1 and another ironworker were standing on a 14 ft 7 in. high  beam to connect another beam. As that beam was swung in  Employee #1 was  knocked off balance and began to fall. He was wearing an appropriate fall  protection harness that was tied to a moveable beam clamp. The beams in the  structure have waists cut into their end points for stress relief that the  workers refer to as ""dog bones"". Because they are narrower at this point the  beam clamps can slide off them. This is what happened when Employee #1 lost  his balance. The clamp came off  and as he fell he first grabbed onto the beam  to slow his descent. He landed  feet first  and was transported to the  hospital as a precautionary measure. Employee #1 suffered minor contusions and  was released after approximately 4 hours. After the accident  the employer  decided to use chokers in place of beam clamps.

The coworker was operating a Sky Trak variable  reach  rough terrain forklift truck  model 10042  serial #13322  with a 10 000  lb maximum load capacity  while Employee #1 was assisting on the ground. The  20 ft long by 32 in. high K-rails were 24 in. wide at the bottom  narrowing to  6 in. wide at the top. Each rail had two 2 in. high by 23.5 in. wide scupper  or fork pockets that were 8 ft apart. The K-rail also had two 4 in. diameter  lifting holes located 12 in. from the top and 3 ft 9 in. from each end.They  were using approximately 41 lb C-shaped K-rail hooks manufactured by Don De  Cristo Concrete Accessories  Code KRHOOK  to pick up and move the K-rails. The  approximately 22 in. by 16 in. by 3/4 in. thick hooks easily slid under the  K-rail's 2 in. high scupper holes. At the time of the accident  the load had  reached its destination and was placed on the ground. Employee #1 removed the  hooks from the K-rail lifting holes and they dropped to the ground between the  forklift and the K-rail. The coworker was not aware that the left hook had  become wedged under the left scupper  and he boomed up and moved the forklift  back. This caused the K-rail to flip over in the direction where Employee #1  was standing. The left corner of the K-rail crushed his left leg below the  knee. He was transported to Loma Linda University Medical Center  where he was  hospitalized for two weeks.

201370954, Employee Dies In Fall From Crane Hook , On July 29  2005  Employee #1 was operating a Rubber Tired Grove Crane. The  crane was used to hoist purlins onto the walls of a steel building. While on  the ground  a hook was attached to purlin and it was lifted into place using a  tagline. After the purlin was placed  the hook was detached and lowered to the  ground. During the operation  the tagline became entangled. Employee #1 was  instructed to untangle the tagline. The crane hook was lowered and he climbed  onto the hoist cable without fall protection. With one foot in the sling  he  held the hoist cable above the hook block with both hands. Then he was hoisted  29.5 ft into the air. As he attempted to untie the tagline from the purlin  he  let go of the cable  causing the sling to swing sideways. The movement of the  swing result in his lost of balance. He fell to the ground  landing on his  back and head. He was flown by helicopter to a medical center where he  remained in a coma until his death thirteen days later.                         
201352812, Employee Killed In Fall From Aerial Lift , On June 5  2005  Employee #1 was part of a crew that was replacing 12 wooden  light poles with aluminum ones. He was operating an Asplundh aerial lift   model L45  that was attached to a 1974 Ford flatbed truck. Employee #1 was in  the lift's bucket preparing to attach a 6 ft long by 3/4 in. thick wire rope  cable to one of the wooden poles. The other end of the cable was attached with  a D-ring to the front of the aerial lift's boom. Employee #1 was using the  boom to attempt to pull the pole from the ground. As weight was applied to the  D-ring  it failed and broke loose from the boom. This caused the boom and  basket to lurch  ejecting Employee #1. He was able to hang on momentarily to  the side of the bucket  but then he fell 18 to 20 ft to the ground and was  killed. Subsequent investigation found that the pole being pulled was actually  buried about 4 ft deep. The employer did not have an operator's manual for  this aerial lift  and neither did the manufacturer. In fact  the manufacturer  stated that the model L45 was manufactured in the 1960s and should have been  removed from service years ago. Employee #1 was not using any form of fall  protection at the time of the accident.                                         
200997286, Worker Is Killed While Installing Helical Piles At Jobsite , On October 21  2008  Employee #1  a laborer  and a coworker  a Bobcat  equipment operator  of Advanced Foundations Systems  Inc. were installing  helical piles to support the foundation of a new building. The coworker  attached hydraulic lines and pushed the leaver activating the bottom wedge and  Employee #1 activated the right lever for the respective bottom wedge to  secure the Bob Tach frame apparatus to the Bobcat. The coworker drove the  Model 864 Bobcat to the location of the site where the helical piles were to  be driven into the ground. The site was 80x60 inch hole about 3 feet deep.  Employee #1 entered the site and placed the pile into position. As the Bob  Tach apparatus was raised into position it fell onto Employee #1  from a  height of approximately 7 feet. The total weight of the attached apparatus was  between 900 and 1 000 pounds.                                                   
200823409, Employee Electrocuted By Energized Plug Receptacle , On November 13  2006  Employee #1 received a call on his cell phone from a  coworker asking him to find the serial/order number of a 480-volt/three-phase  attachment plug so that more attachment plugs could be ordered. Employee #1  found such a plug  possibly choosing it because it was in an idle machine and  the only one not in production. Employee #1 accidentally placed the ground  prong into the energized plug receptacle and grounded out  causing the  third-phase fuse to blow. He was electrocuted. The wiring and the Chicago  Pyle/National attachment plug were found to be very dilapidated and had not  been inspected or maintained. Because of the configuration of the plug  any of  the eight-prong male plugs could have been inadvertently placed in any of the  female receptacles  energizing the metal casing. Because of Employee #1's  medical condition and the fact that there were no electrical burns inside or  outside his body  the coroner considered ruling the cause of death as natural  causes/coronary disease. After continuity testing and destructive testing of  the evidence  the cause of death was ruled to be electrocution.

202486072, Employee'S Thumb Amputated While Installing Water Pipes , On September 24  2007  Employee #1 and two coworkers were engaged in  installing water pumps and piping at a pump station. In this process  it was  necessary to vertically join together 10 ft long assemblies consisting of  three parts. The innermost part was a metal water pipe with an approximately  20 in. diameter. These assemblies weighed several hundred pounds and were  handled using an overhead hoist operated electrically by an operator with a  direct line of sight to the assembly crew. The stainless steel axle  when  fully assembled is driven by an overhead motor and is used to activate an  impeller that drives water vertically up the water pipe. The 7 in. metal axle  housing protects the axle and weighs approximately 200 lb per 10 ft section.  The outermost water pipe carries water upward to large pumps for  transportation through larger water lines. It has collars welded inside it  just large enough to allow the axle housing to be held firmly in place when  installed. At the time of the accident  the stainless steel axle had been  lowered and connected to the axle section below it. The operator was lowering  the axle housing to be threaded into the coupling on the housing section below  it when the axle housing section became caught on a collar inside the  outermost water pipe. This resulted in some slack in the hoist chain that was  not visible inside the water pipe. Not seeing the next section of the axle  housing  Employee #1 put his hand into the water pipe to locate the axle  housing  thinking it was secured by the hoist.

The carport consisted of six  support posts and three open-web steel bar joists spanning across the carport.  One steel support post was in place at each end of the three open-web steel  bar joists. The six steel support posts were approximately 15 to 30 years old  and rusted. Prior to moving the support posts  eight temporary 16-foot  aluminum beams  held up by single post shores  were strategically placed  end-to-end with two at the front of the carport  two at the rear  and four in  the middle. The three open-web steel bar joists were in position with one in  the front  one in the middle  and one at the rear. The bar joists were bolted  in position and supported by post shores  one on each end. The original bar  joists had been removed  sand-blasted  primed  and set back in place. There  were two 2-feet by 4-feet joists nailed diagonally on each of three sides of  the carport to provide lateral support. The crew started work at the front of  the carport and removed the post shores and the two aluminum beams   transferring the weight from the aluminum beams to the open-web steel bar  joists  which were bolted in position and had one post shore at each end for  support.

Employee #1 was assigned as the Lead and was overseeing the  re-spooling. He and Coworker #1 were working at the boom level  and Coworker  #2 was operating the controls based on Employee #1's direction. Employee #1  was standing on a ledge to the right side of the boom  approximately 8 feet 4  inches above the ground. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 both were working at the  boom level without fall protection. Coworker #1 said he safely held onto a  fixed part of the crane to prevent himself from falling. Employee #1 said  there was no handhold where he was standing  so he securely grasped the top of  the boom cover  a fixed structure  by placing the fingers of his left hand  inside the holes as he guided the steel cable with his right hand  on which he  wore a wire glove. According to the employer's Safety Director  Employee #1   while spooling the first layer  needed to hold the cable and tap it with a  hammer to ensure the cable was wrapped tight and close together. The three  employees were almost finished re-spooling the cable  and Coworker #1 was  already on the ground  when Employee #1  still standing at the boom level   directed Coworker #2 to retract the boom  not realizing that his left hand  fingers were still inside the holes of the boom cover. Employee #1's index  finger was pinched between the boom cover and the boom's anti-friction pads   resulting in an amputation. Employee #1 was transported to the hospital  where  he was admitted and treated for amputation of the left hand index finger.  Following its investigation  Cal/OSHA issued two Serious citations  alleging  violations of: Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations (T8 CCR)  section  3210 (b)  for Employer's failure to protect its employee(s) from exposure to  fall of approximately 8 feet 4 inches  while working on the Series 500 C boom  truck cable  by means of fall protection  including but not limited to:  handholds; fall arrest systems; and/or guardrails; and T8 CCR  section 3314  (g)  for Employer's failure to provide and require the use of extension tools  (e.g.  extended swabs  brushes  scrapers) or other methods or means to protect  its employees from injury while re-spooling the cable of the Series 500 C Boom  Truck; employee #1 was using his hand to guide the cable during re-spooling.  Cal/OSHA also issued two General citations for Employer's failure to: complete  and/or document a pre-task report prior to assigning its employees to re-spool  the Series 500 C Boom Truck's cable  as specified in its written Injury and  Illness Prevention Program  a violation of T8 CCR  section 3203 (a); and  include in its Hazardous Energy Control Procedures the following  including  but not limited to: scope; purpose; authorization; rules; techniques to be  utilized for the control of hazardous energy; the means to enforce compliance;  and separate procedural steps for the safe lockout/tagout of each machinery or  equipment  as required  a violation of T8 CCR  section 3314 (g).

200376366, Two Workers Are Injured When Truck Falls Off Bridge , On May 15  2013  Employee #1  the foreman for the street light division   Employee #2  and Coworkers #3  #4  and #5  all employed by Sumter Utilities  Inc.  were removing broken aluminum light poles from the Morrison and Huger  off-ramp of the Ravenel bridge in Charleston  SC. These light poles  which had  been bolted onto the side of the bridge  had broken off and fallen into the  roadway after being struck during an accident earlier in the day. The weather  was warm and clear  with a temperature of 81 degrees. The work crew started  removing the poles at approximately 2:00 p.m.  after the police blocked off  the section of the road they were working in. They had three poles to remove  from this location. They used a 2012 Freightliner with a 2012 Altec Digger  Derrick work body  South Carolina license plate number P728016  48' boom  extended  FMCSA inspected December 2012  Equipment Number 5154  USDOT 278298.  The boom of the Digger Derrick was used to pull the damaged poles up and place  them on the rack of the truck. Employee #1  when subsequently interviewed   stated that he had been trained to always secure the boom by lowering it  completely down to the auger stow bracket before moving the truck. However  on  this occasion he left the boom elevated to approximately 5 feet  at unknown  length of extension  so that Coworkers #3 and #4 could strap the poles down in  the rack. Employee #1 said that he could not remember why he did not make sure  that the boom was secured and resting in the auger stow bracket before getting  off the operating station. Employee #1 said that all of the training he had  received had taught him to make sure the boom was secured before moving the  truck. Employee #1 and Employee #2 were in the Digger Derrick truck  Coworker  #1 was in a bucket truck  Coworker #2 was in another bucket truck  and  Coworker #3 was in a pickup truck. They all began to proceed off the bridge   travelling at a speed of approximately 30 MPH. Suddenly the boom on the Digger  Derrick truck rose up and struck the Meeting Street sign  which was 15 to 18  feet directly above the roadway and measured approximately 18 feet long by 3  feet high. The boom straightened out  and the front of the Digger Derrick  truck reared up. The Digger Derrick truck fell on its right (passenger) side  and slid 30 to 40 feet down the side of the bridge. Then the boom swung around  to the right and pulled the Digger Derrick truck off of the bridge. The Digger  Derrick truck came down on its rear and fell 30 feet to the ground below on  its left (driver) side. Coworkers #1  #2  and #3 stopped their trucks and  looked over the bridge rail. Coworker #1 saw movement in the truck and phoned  for emergency services. Then the three coworkers made their way down to the  accident site. When they arrived  the police and emergency medical service  were onsite  and the coworkers were unable to approach the truck. Employees #1  and #2 were transported to the hospital  admitted  and treated. The initial  report on injuries indicated that Employee # 1 had two fractured ribs and  fluid in his chest as well as a chipped bone in his shoulder. Employee #2 had  cuts and bruises to his face  and strains and bruises to his back  shoulder   and leg. Both employees required extensive surgeries and  at the time of this  report  had not returned to work.

201088929, Employee Is Injured When Ejected From Bucket ," On December 6  2006  a three-person crew  consisting of Employee #1  who was a  lineman  a foreman/groundsman  and a traffic control flagman  was removing  communication lines and poles as part of a road-widening project in Visalia   CA. The main line ran east/west  with the subject white pole (""P1/gas  treated"") located at the west side of an intersection  where it received a  ""T-line"" from the north. A guy was provided at mid-pole height opposite the  ""T-line"". The wrecking operation had proceeded from the west to the subject  pole. The foreman supported the conductor with a rope for lowering  while  Employee #1  who was elevated in a manbucket on the north side of the pole   released the conductor/strand hanger. Just after the hanger was released  the  pole failed at a point between 18 inches and 24 inches above the guy attaching  point. The ""T-line"" caused the line bearing the weight of the pole to pin  Employee #1 against the bucket and render him unconscious. The foreman called  emergency medical services and attempted to lower and move the aerial device   which had become caught because of the lateral load. He then went to retrieve  a digger with the capacity to lift the line  but before he returned  Employee  #1 had regained consciousness and cut the strand. This released the lateral  force and caused the boom to rebound and eject Employee #1 from the bucket.  His personal fall arrest system prevented further injury. Employee #1 was  transported to the hospital  where he was admitted for cervical and lumbar  spinal fractures. The subsequent investigation determined that the root cause  of the accident was a hidden defect in the utility pole  which was guyed and  appeared to be structurally sound. Because employees were not required to  climb the pole  inspection and ""Butt"" testing was not required. Inspection  procedures would have required a visual appraisal  in addition to driving  nails  and sounding of the pole at the first 2 feet above the ground.  Employees demonstrated knowledge of safe procedures and of the hazards  pertaining to wrecking operations. The employer had a well-devised and  implemented safety and health program.                                          "
200830750, Employee Electrocuted When Boom Strikes Power Line , On November 7  2003  Employee #1  a laborer with C.A.C. Industries  Inc.  was  operating a pile driver.

200711158, Employee Killed When Bucket Truck Overturns , Employee #1 was operating a Hi-Ranger bucket truck that was positioned behind  a Manitowoc boom truck being operated by a coworker as they installed  insulators on a cement pole. Employee #1 was just starting to lower the lower  boom of the Hi-Ranger when the boom of the Manitowoc began to swing at a high  speed to the right. The coworker grabbed the controller but it would not stop.  The Manitowoc boom swung so fast that it put enough tension on the bucket  truck boom to break the hold-back cable and continued to push the upper boom  over. This released the leveling cables on the Hi-Ranger bucket truck and  caused it to flip over  throwing Employee #1 out of the cab. He fell to the  ground and sustained fatal head injuries. When the remote controls were later  tested  the remote START button was hit and the swing controller actuator  pulled the swing lever full right. When the emergency STOP button was hit  it  would kick out of neutral  but when it was pulled on again the swing lever  went to full swing right. There was apparently a malfunction with the  controller. Further evaluation showed that the servo-actuator had also  malfunctioned.

14456982, Employee Killed When Caught By Boom Line Spool And Crushed , A 225-ton American crawler crane was being demobilized for shipment. Employee  #1 was helping to wind the boom line  whip line  and main load line onto their  base spools. Because there were no loads on the lines  they were resistant to  being rolled  and tended to overlap or lay unevenly. Employee #1 was standing  in a 34 in. wide opening that was approximately 3 1/2 ft between the boom line  and whip line spools and a metal guard/shield. The shield was an integral  but  not a structural  part of the machine and it was intended to guard against  workers falling into the rotating auxiliary shaft and clutch during normal  maintenance of the crane. The whip line spool and boom line spool were on a  common horizontal axis  but rotated independently. The lines ran over the tops  of the spools  putting them slightly below Employee #1's head as they were  drawn from the horizontal boom. He guided the lines  as necessary  to yield an  even tight lay. By this point  the whip line had been secured and the boom  line was being spooled at 16 rpm. Employee #1 was standing on a metal floor  and apparently was astride the continuously rotating auxiliary 5 in. diameter  shaft. To one end of the shaft was attached a 27-in. diameter friction clutch   which operated the whip line spool and was open on the side closest to the  employee. Employee #1 had on a safety belt with a shoulder harness and  lanyard. It appears that Employee #1's clothing or lanyard became caught in  the rotating parts. The clutch continued to rotate approximately 3/4 turn  after Employee #1 alerted the operator that he was caught. He was pulled into  a 13 in. area and killed.

The cause of the accident was  the machine lifting off of the tracks and crushing the Operator and injuring  the laborer.                                                                    
201044898, Excavator Is Killed In Pressurized Release Of Grout And Rock , On June 11  2012  Employee #1  of Vegas Tunnel Constructors  Las Vegas  NV   was part of a swing shift crew excavating a tunnel. They were using a tunnel  boring machine (TBM). The TBM had been excavating in closed mode for  approximately 17 days. Closed mode is a term used to describe one of two modes  of operation this TBM was capable of performing  the other being open mode.  Closed mode excavation involves the pressurization of the cutterhead and face  of the TBM to support the ground and/or control excessive groundwater inflows.  The position of the TBM found it excavating through a large vertical fault  zone that later became the Detachment Fault. The ground conditions required  the TBM face to be pressurized to approximately 13 bars of pressure. The grout  being injected in the annular space was being pumped in at approximately 14  bars. The swing shift had begun work and was preparing to erect a ring segment  set; Ring #135. The swing shift began to build Ring #135 at about 4:00 p.m.  The first segment was successfully installed in the tunnel crown (top of the  tunnel). The crew then began to install the second segment  which was to be  placed in front of the keystone of Ring #134. Three hydraulic rams  including  one abutting the keystone of Ring #134  were slowly retracted. Almost as soon  as the retraction began  a loud pop was heard. Some members of the crew  reported hearing a second pop. The keystone for Ring #134 had shifted forward  approximately 4 inches. The come-a-long did not hold the forces exerted  and  the gears were stripped out. This shift permitted grout and other materials  such as rocks to escape the annulus at a pressure of approximately 14 bars  (200 psi). Employee #1 was standing in front of the area where the gap  developed. He was struck and killed by the moving grout and rocks. Coworkers  found Employee #1 and removed him from the tunnel.

Also at the site were a  coworker  who was a drill operator  and a foreman. All three employees were  employed by a commercial contractor that specializes in street and traffic  light installations in Southern California. Employee #1 was a locator  who  walked on the ground surface to locate the underground directional drill head  using a detector unit to track the horizontal and angle movement of the drill  head. This information was communicated back to the coworker  who was the  operator seated on the directional boring machine (a Vermeer Number D24x40  Horizontal Directional Drill). The horizontal directional drill was used to  dig under cement  pavement  and earth to lay electrical lines for street and  traffic lights. The head of the drill first made a path through the soil  underneath the ground  until it arrived at its destination. A line was then  pulled through it  so electrical lines could be installed to hookup traffic  and signal lights for public streets and freeways. The front section of the  horizontal directional boring machine was outfitted with a left and right  anchor boring unit with stakes. The stakes were large auger units that tapped  into the ground vertically to stabilize the machine when its drilling rods  apparently ran horizontally  underneath the ground. The bolt holding the auger  bit to the shaft on the main frame of the directional boring machine came off   and the coworker had to take it apart to get to the dislodged bolt.  Apparently  the coworker tightened the bolt  got up on the directional boring  machine  seated himself  and unsuccessfully attempted to line up the square  piece fitting of the shaft over the top of the auger attachment. Employee #1  came over and used his left hand to try and line up the shaft  while the  coworker manipulated the controls  in an attempt to attach the shaft to the  auger bit. The shaft dropped on employee's #1 left thumb  causing the top one  inch to be amputated. The foreman transported Employee #1 to U.S. HealthWorks  First and later transported him to the Orthopedic Center in La Jolla. Employee  #1 was hospitalized and required outpatient surgery the day after the  accident. The Division was notified about the accident on May 18  2007.

He was walking on a wood platform on the fourth floor of the building  under construction. The platform measured 9 feet 11 inches long by 47.5 inches  wide and was not guarded on the north  south  and east sides. A gust of wind  or some other factor caused Employee #1 to fall from the platform. He fell to  a concrete floor area on the third floor below  a distance of approximately 10  feet 8.25 inches.

LLC  with which  Agility had worked numerous times on other job sites. Agility's project  manager had responsibility for overseeing the labor (the HAR employees) and  the ordering and delivery of all the building materials. The project manager  for Agility did the majority of the lay out and mark up of the different units  on each floor. Agility dealt directly with the Clark Builders Group officials.  HAR Construction Co. LLC had 52 employees working at this site. They had been  at the site since early January 2013. There were two foremen  two crew  leaders  16 carpenters  and 32 skilled laborers. Their employees were working  all over the large project. Employee #1 had been one of the two carpentry crew  leaders. On other jobs he had been a foreman. He had worked for HAR  Construction Co. for 8 years. As a crew leader he checked on the four groups  of carpenters working throughout the project. He used a chalk line to lay out  where the walls were to be constructed. He also assisted in undoing the  rigging on the different loads of materials and equipment lifted up and onto  the different floor levels by the tower crane. Prior to his fall  Employee #1  was up on the fourth floor conducting various work duties. During the  investigation  Coworker #1 stated that he believed it was approximately 9:00  a.m. when Employee #1  while still up on the fourth floor  walked over near  the work area on the third floor where Coworker #1 was working.

200271872, Employee Is Struck By Broken Boom And Dies , On July 23  2008  Employee #1 was working with a crew to set open web bar  joists for a roof system on a precast concrete building. Coworker #1 was  operating a Link-Belt LS 218H crane to hoist bar joist to the crew working  from man lifts. Employee #1 was part of the crew working from the man lifts.  Coworker #2 heard a snapping noise and saw the boom hoist wire rope breaking  apart between the drum and the top of the Gantry. Coworker #2 yelled to  Coworker #1 that the boom hoist cable broke  causing the boom to fall. The  boom struck Employee #1 in the elevated man lift. Employee #1 collapsed   suffered blunt force trauma  and later died. The weather at the site was warm  and sunny with little to no wind.                                               
202499448, Employee Injured In Fall When Scaffold Cable Snaps , On November 8  2007  Employee #1 was using a single point suspension scaffold.  He had raised it to a height of approximately 90 ft when he heard a grinding  sound in the motor. Employee #1 was attempting to bump past the grinding sound  when the wire rope snapped and the scaffold fell to the pavement. Employee #1  sustained facial injuries  for which he was hospitalized. He was wearing a  personal fall arrest system  which saved him from being killed or from  suffering more serious injuries. The wire rope had pre-existing damage  but it  had not been inspected prior to use.                                            
200676872, Employee Killed In Fall Over Side Of High Rise , On July 13  2007  Employee #1 and coworkers were working on the thirty-fourth  floor of a high-rise construction  using jacks to lower a shoring formwork  table from the concrete slab above. The shoring table was being used to  support the floor slabs on the southwest side of the building as they were  poured. There was a catwalk attached to the top of the shoring table which  extended 6 ft over the edge of the building. This catwalk provided a work  platform to finish the edge of the concrete slab after it was poured. Employee  #1 entered the shoring table from the inboard side through one of the truss  webs to remove a piece of plywood that was nailed to the floor. While Employee  #1 was inside the truss  his coworkers at the ends of the truss were having  difficulty lowering the shoring table because the plywood deck on the table  was stuck to the underside of the concrete slab. A stringer beam connected  each end of the trusses. Employee #1's coworkers lowered the jacks to  approximately 6 in. below the jack point at the center of the stringer beam.  Employee #1 was at the east end of the shoring table and was using a very long  breaker bat to pop the plywood from the slab. He was able to separate them  when the table fell onto the jacks. Employee #1 was tied off to a retractable  cable that was anchored to a concrete column on the same side of the truss  that he had entered. When the table fell  it kicked out the jack on the east  end of the shoring table toward the inside of the building. The weight of the  catwalk pulled the truss over the edge of the building on the south side. As  the shoring table fell over the side of the building  Employee #1 was dragged  with sufficient force that it snapped the reractable cable. He fell with the  shoring table approximately 230 ft  dropping to an eleventh story setback. The  shoring table was destroyed and Employee #1 was killed. The other tables being  used in the building  did not have the catwalk attached to the top of the  shoring table  which added additional weight to the side.                       
201344496, Two Employees Killed In Fall When Gondola Cable Breaks , At approximately 9:20 a.m. on July 10  2007  Employee #1  the company owner   and Employee #2  a helper  both ironworkers  were replacing television  transmission equipment 920 ft up on a 1 000 ft communications tower. They were  riding a gondola-style man-basket pulled by a 1/4 in. wire rope up a trolley  line that was anchored to a 16 ft flatbed trailer approximately 450 ft from  the base of the 1 000 ft high tower. When the man-basket was approximately  three-quarters of the way up  the wire rope line broke. The man-basket fell  back down the trolley line  striking the ground and then the anchor point.  Both Employee #1 and Employee #2 were tied off to the basket and were killed  on impact. The coworker winch operator was not injured. The tower had been  rigged approximately two weeks earlier by Employee #1.                          
200624047, Employee Is Killed When Crane Cable Fails And Releases Load , On October 5  2006  Employee #1  a welder  was working at a construction  jobsite where a Link-Belt 218 lattice boom crawler crane was used to move a  10 000-lb MKT V22 vibratory hammer. During the handling operation  the crane's  gantry cable parted and the boom fell on a railroad car and a railroad bridge.  The vibratory hammer was also released  and it struck and pinned Employee #1  to the ground. He sustained multiple body fractures and was killed as a  result.                                                                         
201353141, Employee Killed In Fall From Hoist Line On Communication Tow , On June 25  2006  Employee #1 was part of a crew that was removing antenna  equipment from a 1 900-ft communication tower for placement on another tower.  One of the workers was on the ground operating the Hydraulic Power Systems   Inc.  hoisting unit. Two workers were at a height of approximately 1 800 ft on  the tower  removing the equipment. Once it was free  they would connect it to  a 5/8-in. nylon rope  and the hoist operator would lower it to about the 600  ft level of the tower  where Employee #1 was located. He was connected to and  suspended by a 1/2 in. wire rope hoist line. Once the equipment reached him   he would connect it to the hoist line  and the hoist operator would then lower  him and the equipment to the ground. Employee #1 would disconnect the  equipment  and then be raised back up to wait for the next load. During the  course of the operations  Employee #1 was being raised when the nylon rope  broke. The approximately 100 lb equipment attached to the rope fell from  approximately 1 800 ft  as did a headache ball that was also attached to the  rope. The broken end of the rope became tangled on the rigging block that was  on top of the tower. This caused the nylon rope to suddenly stop  and the  shock caused the it to break again at a point just above the headache ball.  The nylon rope  headache ball  and equipment fell until they struck Employee  #1 on the hoist line. He was connected to the line with a CM chain repair link  that was not designed to be part of a personal fall protection or positioning  system. The link separated and Employee #1 fell about 550 ft to the ground. He  was killed. Subsequent investigation revealed several problems with the  hoisting system: the rigging  hoist line  and slings that were used to raise  personnel had not been installed with a 10:1 safety factor; Employee #1 was on  the hoist line while another load was suspended from the same hoist unit;  Employee #1 connected his fall protection/positioning device to a shackle  above the hook rather than using a lanyard that had been placed directly on  the hook; and no anti-two-blocking device was installed on the personnel  hoisting line. It was believed that the nylon rope was cut by the wire rope  where they both passed through the same double-block rigging device at  approximately 500 ft on the tower.                                              
201059292, Employee Dies After Being Struck By Broken Cable , At approximately 12:00 p.m. on January 7  2005  Employee #1  was working for  Archer Electric Company  a licensed machinery rebuilder. He was standing on  top of the machine at rail level  watching the transmission being installed  onto a Wheel True Machine at the truck shop. There were three coworkers  standing below the rail lever bolting the transmission to a steel plate with  the transmission being held suspended using an overhead crane. A hook was  attached to the eyebolt to suspend the load using a steel plate with a hole in  the middle. The eyebolt was passed through the hole in the plate and secured  on the bottom using a nut and two washers. While the load was suspended inches  in the air  the eyebolt somehow broke into two pieces  causing the wire rope  cable to react through the opening  creating a helicopter effect. The wire  rope cable  and/or broken eyebolt/hook struck the employee on the right upper  cheekbone  knocking him to the floor. Employee #1 was taken to County USC  Medical Center by the paramedic  where he later died; the cause of death was  head trauma. Cal/OSHA determined the accident was caused by the mechanical  fatigue of the brand new eyebolt used to connect the load to the crane. The  forged steel eyebolt was rated with a work load limit of 4 000 lbs. and the  weight of the transmission was determined to be about 600 lbs. at the most.  The accident was caused by an unexpected mechanical failure.

200514560, Employee Killed In Fall When Stairway Railing Fails , At approximately 2:22 p.m. on November 7  2007  Employee #1  a welder for E &  J Rebar  Inc.  and two coworkers were on the upper landing of the stairway  over the north side of the St. Louis Park Pedestrian Bridge. Employee #1 was  wearing a full body harness and had tied his lanyard to a double-eyed choker  that was attached to the stairway railing. He was moving from the southwest  side to the northwest side when he leaned against the railing and it  disconnected from the structural members. He fell 15 ft 2 in. to the ground   with the railing section landing on top of him. Employee #1 died of blunt  force craniocerebral injuries sustained in the fall. The stairway railing to  which he was tied off was not permanently secured and/or bolted into place.  The St. Louis Park Police Department report and photographs depicted Employee  #1's position after the fall. His left leg was underneath the railing  his  right leg was over the railing  and his right foot was tangled between the  metal slats of the railing  with fresh welding fume on the shim of the stair  stringer. The rail between his legs and the freshly-welded shim on the  stringer indicated that Employee #1 was straddling the railing to weld when he  fell. There were no ladders or JLG-type of aerial lifts observed in the area.  The toxicology report was negative.                                             
200823698, Employee Injured In Fall Down Stairs During Installation Con , On October 10  2007  Employee #1  an iron worker  was setting metal stair  frame stringers at approximately 45 degrees  from one landing to the next  upper landing. Metal erection clips were tack-welded by coworkers at each end  of the stringers to hold them in place. The placement clips were tack-welded  to each landing until the entire metal stairwell was assembled for a final  weld. Employee #1 was working at the upper landing  pounding the stringers  into place to align the upper position of the stringer with its position at  the lower landing. Apparently  the welds for one of the metal clips failed   causing the metal clip to bend upward nearly 90 degrees from its original  position. Employee #1 was pounding on the stringer when the clip failed and  the two stringers fell. He lost his balance while swinging the heavy hammer  and fell 14 ft 6 in.  fracturing his skull  his left shoulder  his right arm   and several ribs. Because Employee #1 was working at a height of less than 15  ft  fall protection was not an enforceable issue.                               
200212215, Employee Killed In Fall When Catwalk Collapses , At approximately 4:00 p.m. on August 6  2007  Employee #1  a boilermaker  was  cutting a catwalk grating that was sitting on 31 ft high channels. Earlier  that morning  one end of this grating and channel had been cut and removed.  Employee #1 was standing on this section while cutting the next section. When  he finished cutting the grating completely through  the channel and grating  gave way. They fell  along with Employee #1  to the next level of the catwalk.  He landed on some debris  fell to one side  and then struck the top guardrail.  Employee #1 was killed. When the channel was later lowered for inspection  it  was found that the previous welding was porous  rusted  and lacked  penetration. At the time of the accident  Employee #1 was wearing a harness  and lanyard but he was not tied off.                                            
200354843, Employee'S Arm Crushed By Falling Pipe ," On May 12  2005  Employee #1  of Acorn Industrial  Inc.  was removing welds  from a 30 in. CHR pipe in a utility tunnel  so the pipe could be repositioned  and re-welded in place. The pipe was normally suspended by permanent supports  spaced throughout the tunnel  as well as by temporary ""trapeze"" supports  mounted to the ceiling and positioned to hold up the pipe where it was not  adequately held by the permanent supports during installation. In the place  where Employee #1 was working  there was no permanent support in place. On the  previous day  a separate crew had received approval from the foreman and from  Employee #1 to also remove the temporary support because this top run of pipe  had been completely fit up and tack-welded in place at two joints: the west  joint and the east joint. A subsequent inspection of the welds had revealed a  misalignment of the pipe at the west joint. To correct this  Employee #1 and  the foreman decided to remove about 18 in. of the 30 in. CHR pipe at the west  joint (including the misaligned weld)  refit the two pipe ends  and redo the  weld at this location. The pipe was manually rolled to allow access to all  portions of it  due to the close proximity to the north wall. During the  rolling of the pipe  three tack welds at the west joint cracked; they were  re-welded back in place  but they cracked again during subsequent rolling of  the pipe while the victim continued cutting the pipe at the east joint. After  the tack welds cracked the second time  the foreman and Employee #1 decided to  start over at the west joint. At this point Employee #1 had completely severed  the pipe at the east joint. The foreman told Employee #1 to check his rigging  and grind out the remaining three tack welds at the west joint with a  hand-held grinder. This would allow the crew to reposition the entire 30 in.  CHR pipe and weld it back in place. The foreman left the area to continue  layout for expansion joints in another vault  and Employee #1 and his helper  continued to work at the west joint. He ground out the three broken tack welds  while they were at the bottom of the pipe  instead of rolling the pipe to put  the tack welds in a better position. At this point  the only support for the  pipe was the permanent support  about 24 ft 4 in. away  and approximately 12  ft of the pipe extended over the support structure near the east joint. The  pipe was about 38 ft long before the removal of 18 in. at the east joint.  Employee #1 was removing the tack welds from the bottom of the pipe when it  fell  crushing his right arm against the 30 in. CHS pipe below. He suffered  injuries that required hospitalization. The temporary ""trapeze"" support would  have adequately held the pipe's weight if it had been reinstalled when the  workers realized they were going to remove the tack welds at the west joint  and completely sever the pipe at the east joint. Employee #1 had been using a  Ross ""come-a-long"" to help him shift/roll the pipe for the refit. The  ""come-a-long"" was off center and therefore not in place to support the pipe;  it could only provide offset force to shift or roll the pipe. -----             "
201172483, Employee Is Killed When Crushed By Falling Ripper Shank , At approximately 11:15 a.m. on September 24  2002  Employee #1  a foreman for  Ford Construction  and a coworker mechanic were at a site in Lincoln  CA   changing out the 10-foot to 12-foot long  2 178-pound ripper shank on a D-10  bulldozer. The vehicle was backed to the edge of a lot pad approximately 4  feet above their level. The tool bar was elevated to its highest position to  allow the ripper shank to be drawn up into the bar's tool slot  and then  pinned into place for use. They were using a light crane mounted on the  coworker's service truck to lift the ripper shank into place. The load line of  the crane was lowered down through the slot to be pinned into position. The  chain was attached to the ripper by a welded eye on the end of the ripper   through which the chain had been looped and the chain hook slot fit to a link  to form a loop. The ripper bar had been pulled up to the bottom of the tool  bar and both workers were trying to align the top of the ripper to the slot in  the tool bar. The mechanic had a pry bar at the point of the ripper and  Employee #1 had a pry bar through the pin hole in the bar  twisting the ripper  bar in an attempt to get the ripper in place. As they were working  the chain  attaching the ripper bar to the crane hook became detached and the ripper  shank fell on Employee #1. He sustained crushing injuries and a torn aorta.  The coworker used his pry bar to lever the ripper shank off of Employee #1   and he then radioed for help. Employee #1 was transported by helicopter to the  hospital  where he died as a result of his injuries.

As part of the project  a lake that was in  the path of the planned roadway had to be filled  using sand from an adjacent  ""borrow pit"". Employee #1 began operating the Model Number D9H bulldozer at  approximately 8:00 a.m. and moved the bulldozer to the lake at approximately  8:45 a.m.  after another bulldozer suffered a mechanical failure. The  superintendent instructed Employee #1 about the fill pattern (east to west)  and left him unattended. At approximately 9:30 a.m.  the superintendent  who  was working 200 yards north of the lake  noted the absence of sound for the  fill location at the lake. He proceeded to the lake but was unable to find the  Model Number D9H bulldozer or Employee #1. Employee #1 had driven the  Caterpillar bulldozer into the lake  while moving fill material  and he  drowned. The Investigation revealed that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was in  reverse  and the throttle position was at full  as confirmed by underwater  photographs. The transmission had three forward and three reverse gears. For  unknown reasons  Employee #1 had pushed a large amount of fill into the lake   in the center of the fill area  instead of moving in a consistent left to  right pattern. The reason for the left to right pattern was to slowly extend  the line of fill into the lake consistently  so that it could support the  weight of the equipment. It appears that the Model Number D9H bulldozer was on  this central peninsula  which failed under the weight  and caused the  bulldozer and Employee #1 to enter the lake.

200452860, Employee Is Hit By Bulldozer , The Employee was trained by the foreman and tasked to take laser grade  readings after the bulldozer operator spread dirt on the foundation pad. The  bulldozer operator would normally make three runs (forward and backward)  spreading the pile of dirt by thirds about 30 to 50 feet from the pile. At the  time of the incident the bulldozer operator was filling in a slight hole about  2 inches deep caused by the blade of the dozer dipping on his last backward  run. The hole was only about 20 feet forward of where the operator directed  the dump truck operator to dump the dirt. This made the forward run a lot  shorter than normal. The bulldozer operator made his run forward  however   stopped shorter than normal due to the dirt filling in the hole. The bulldozer  operator would normally put the dozer in reverse on the fly which means as he  is moving forward he would raise the blade  slow down  put it in reverse   start moving backwards  lower the blade  and then look behind him. Since it  was a shot run (only 10 - 15 feet to fill in the hole)  as he started to move  backwards it was about 2-3 seconds before he looked behind him  and when he  did noticed either the hard hat or survey rod fly in the air and he knew he  had struck the employee. The employee either had started to walk behind the  bulldozer once it passed him or was standing to close to the dirt pile and was  struck when the bulldozer operator turned to line up his next run with the  pile.

201183928, Two Employees Burned By Hot Water Release ," At 12:36 p.m. on August 6  2007  Employees #1 and #2  a foreman and an  electrician  respectively  for Koffler Electrical Mechanical Apparatus Repair   Inc.  were dispatched to a hotel boiler room to replace the broken motor of a  pump for the hotel's hot water piping system. There were four sets of motor  and pump units in the boiler room. Two months prior to this job  Employee #1  had replaced one of these set. On the day of the accident  they were replacing  another motor and pump unit. All the valves were shut and the motor and pump  unit had been removed from the 12 in. hot water pipe when a motor from one of  the other three units automatically restarted. Employee #1 heard a whooshing  sound coming from the open water pipe  and 120 degress F water started to  spray out. Employee #1 attempted to cap off the pipe; Employee #2 went to  notify the hotel engineer and then returned to help Employee #1. The hotel  engineer was checking the valves and tightening some nuts and bolts on the  couplings when Employees #1 and #2 were suddenly sprayed with hot water.  Paramedics responded and both employees were taken to St. Francis Hospital.  Employee #1 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to his abdomen.  Employee #2 was treated for first- and second-degree burns to the back of his  legs. The employer was cited for two general accident-related violations. The  hotel had only one check valve for the 12 in. hot water pipe that served the  entire 42-story building. There were no other intermediate check valves  throughout the piping system. California Code of Regulations T8 3329(d)  states: ""When dismantling or opening closed pressurized or gravity fed  systems  internal pressure shall be relieved or other methods utilized to  prevent sudden release of pressure or spraying of liquid."" One of the  functions of the check valve would have been to prevent backflow. It was  discovered after the incident that the check valve was not working properly.  As a result  it did not have the capacity to stop the water from flowing back  into the boiler room. The other general accident-related violations are from  T8 GISO section 3314(c) and (g)  which require a lockout/de-energizing of  electrical equipment. Prior to the removal of the motor and pump unit  the  other 3 units were not de-energized to prevent them from building-up water  pressure of a minimum of 20 psi. The boiler was also not shut down to prevent  build-up of water temperature. A hazard control procedure was not developed by  the employer. A reference was also made to T8 3314(i)  which required on-site  lockout procedures to be followed by outside servicing personnel.               "

Cal/OSHA received a report from the San Francisco Fire Department on  March 16  2013. The employer reported to Cal/OSHA four days later  apparently  not knowing the reporting requirement. Cal/OSHA conducted an investigation on  March 22  2013 at the worksite. The investigation included interviews with  Employee #1 and Coworker #1. The investigation determined that the employer  installs countertops and performs other stone related work for residential  homes. On the day the injury occurred  no foreman was present at the work  site. Employee #1 was functioning as lead worker. He had approximately 20  years of experience in woodwork and stonework  the last 10 working for  Stoneplus  Inc. Cal/OSHA cited the employer a general violation of 1509(a) for  not having an Injury and Illness Prevention Program. The Program requirement  includes a requirement for the employer to provide and document training for  employees. The employer had no documentation of Employee #1's training. In  addition  the use of the powered circular saw was not appropriate for reducing  the thickness of the wood board. The employer was also cited for not notifying  Cal/OSHA immediately of the work-related injury. The investigator observed  other violations  and the employer was cited accordingly.

The  employee was transferred to Loma Linda Medical Center  where he was  hospitalized and underwent surgery.                                             
202587861, Carpenter'S Finger Amputation Is Traced To Lack Of Training ," At approximately 5:30 p.m. on October 22  2012  Employee #1  a carpenter  employed by RW Garage Doors  Inc.  was installing a new garage door at a  private residence in San Leandro  CA. He was working alone  standing near the  garage entrance  and cutting a piece of trim to custom fit the new garage door  to the existing frame. The trim was a 3-foot to 4-foot long piece of 2-inch by  1-inch lumber  originally cut from a 16-foot long piece. Employee #1 was in  the process of cutting the lumber using a Craftsman 14 Amp 7.25-inch Circular  Saw  Model Number 320.10870. This was a left-handed saw that belonged to  Employee #1  although he was right-handed. He was handling the saw in his left  hand and holding the wood being cut with his right hand while kneeling down.  While making the cut  Employee #1 was pushing the saw with his left hand and  resisting the force with the wood in his right hand. He held the wood in an  underhanded position  with his right thumb grasping the wood over the top  his  palm supporting it from beneath  and his other fingers curling around the  back. He planned to slide his hand around toward the back of the wood to move  his hand/fingers further away from the saw blade. As he attempted to do this   the saw blade amputated his right hand's pinkie finger just past the first  knuckle. He required hospitalization for the amputation. At 3:53 p.m. on  October 23  2012  the employer reported this event to Cal/OSHA. Employee #1  later told the Cal/OSHA investigator that he may have misjudged how close his  hand was to the advancing blade  how far his fingers were crosswise to the  blade  and the depth the blade was set to cut. From the interview with  Employee #1  the investigator concluded that Employee #1's assessment of what  he might have done differently to avoid injury was faulty. Specifically   Employee #1 did not utilize the following safe practices indicated in the  Operator's Manual for the saw: ""Do not reach underneath the work. Always clamp  the work piece securely so it will not move when making the cut. Avoid awkward  operations and hand positions where a sudden slip could cause your hand to  move into the blade."" According to the investigation report  the primary  factor leading to this injury was the employer's failure to provide training  to Employee #1. The employer was relying on the employee's past experience.  This  in turn  led to the employee using poor and/or faulty judgment to assess  the hazards involved.                                                           "

The wall fell over and landed on Employee #1's  leg. Emergency services were called  and Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  admitted  and treated for a fractured leg. This event was  investigated by Washington State OSHA. According to the investigation report's  documentation of events  Employee #1 had pre-assembled the wall on the ground  and had added .5-inch plywood to the face for rigidity and a 6-inch piece of  cold roll steel channel on top for connecting the wall to the structure. On  the night of December 17  2013  the wall had been lifted by crane into the  space on the roof directly in front of the installation area. On the morning  of December 18  2013  the wall was not reattached to the crane for stability   and the only other support  a lanyard tied around a steel column and through  the window of the wall  was removed. The investigation determined that the  project manager/superintendent and the assistant safety director had assigned  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 the task of installing the wall. The field  engineer and the project manager/superintendent verbally admitted they did not  have a site-specific erection plan  did not inform Employee #1 and Coworker #1  of the wall's weight  and did not design any temporary type of guying or  bracing to secure the wall and protect the workers.

Their assignment was to demolish an old   leaning cinder block wall that was approximately 7 feet high by 50 feet long.  Coworker #1 was experienced in this type of work and had been demolishing  walls for more than 29 years. Coworker #1 was operating a skid-steer tractor  with a hydraulic breaker attachment. He removed approximately 3 feet of cinder  block from the top of the wall to confirm the presence of reinforcing steel  and reduce the height of the wall. He observed that there was both vertical  and horizontal rebar in the wall and that the wall was stable. Coworker #1  removed the soil that was exposed after removing the top of the wall. He then  removed vertical slot sections of the wall approximately 6 inches wide to  obtain an approximately 4-foot section of wall  which he then would pull over  with the skid-steer. During these procedures Coworker #1 would continually  watch the wall for any indication of instability and pull on the wall with the  skid-steer to ensure it would not tip over. He saw no indication of any  structural problems. When the wall had been reduced to approximately 4 feet  from the ground  it contained a horizontal steel reinforcing bar that needed  to be cut before Coworker #1 could pull the wall down and enable the cutting  of the vertical reinforcing steel bars. Employee #1 was cutting these  horizontal steel reinforcing bars with a hand- held portable cut-off saw. The  first 4-foot section of wall had been removed following this procedure without  a problem. Coworker #1 prepared another 4-foot section of wall in the same  way. Employee #1 cut the top horizontal rebar  and then the next horizontal  rebar below  and began to position himself to cut the next rebar below. The  next 4-foot wide section of wall suddenly toppled and fell on him. Emergency  services were called  and the Los Angeles City Fire Department responded.  Employee #1 was transported to LAC+USC Medical Center  where he was admitted  and treated for a fractured pelvis and internal injuries. The Los Angeles City  Fire Department reported this incident to Cal/OSHA at approximately 8:45 a.m.  on September 10  2013. The employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA at 7:55  a.m. on September 11  2013  after the employer learned that Employee #1 would  be hospitalized for more than 24 hours. The Cal/OSHA investigator arrived at  the work site at approximately 9:50 a.m. on September 19  2013 and began the  investigation. The investigation determined that the vertical steel  reinforcing bars in the wall were rusted away at the base and did not hold the  wall section up the way they had in the first section. The employer did not  block or brace the next wall section before allowing Employee #1 to work  adjacent to the wall  and he was injured when the wall fell over onto him. At  the time of this report  Cal/OSHA planned to issue a serious citation T8 CCR  1735(d)(4). Demolishing Buildings. (4) During demolition  continuing  inspections shall be made as the work progresses to detect hazards resulting  from weakened or deteriorated floors or walls  or loosened material. Employees  shall not be permitted to work where such hazards exist until they are  corrected by shoring  bracing  or other effective means.

The  I-beam was supported by three vertical 10 foot H-beam support columns.  Employee #1 cut one of the outer most end support columns at the floor level  completely in two. After cutting that column  the weight of the remaining  steel structure became off balanced and caused the middle column and the third  column to fall. Witnesses stated that it appeared that Employee #1 walked  under the steel structure after making the first column cut. Witnesses also  indicated that Employee #1 looked up as the structure began to fall on top of  him  but he could not get away. Witnesses stated that after the worker cut the  first column  there was approximately a four to five second pause before it  fell over. The collapse started at the south end column  which had been cut   and then the middle column began to pull away from its concrete anchor  supports. The third and last column held at the floor anchor supports  but the  sheer weight bent that column over causing total collapse. Workers in the area  ran to Employee #1's aid and used a 220 Komatsu excavator to lift the beams  off of Employee #1 and move it away. Emergency responders pronounced Employee  #1 dead at the scene.

The millwright contractor's employees   including Coworkers #1 and #2  were removing all equipment related to the leg  elevator and distributor. Coworker #1 was operating a manual chain hoist to  lower portions of equipment (flow retarder  cushion and/or baffle) just above  where the already removed distributor would have been. Coworker #2 was in the  process of cutting the four thread bolts that held the equipment together. The  second bolt needed to be cut but could not be reached from the catwalk on  which Coworker #2 stood. Coworker #2 had left his fall protection equipment in  the trailer. Therefore  Employee #2 used his fall arrest system and tied off  on the super structure. He was standing approximately 9 feet above the  walking/working surface  that is  the top of the silo. The equipment they were  removing had one open hole in the top and one open hole in the bottom. It was  a very windy day. Employee #1 used an oxy-acetylene torch to cut the second  bolt. Combustible dust exploded and created a flash fire  which caused  Employee #1 to fall. Employee #1's 6-foot Protecta brand shock absorbing  lanyard partially activated and broke his fall. Coworker #1 called for  emergency services and then helped Employee #1 remove his harness  enter an  aerial lift  and return to the ground. Employee #1 was transported by  emergency response personnel to the nearest hospital and then flown to a  hospital burn unit in Iowa City. He was hospitalized and treated for burns to  his arms  face  head  and neck.

200461440, Two Workers Died Due To Malfunctioning Respiratory Devices , Two commercial diving contractors were subcontracted to remove bulkheads from  the bottom of 55 vertical diffusers in a nine-mile tunnel below the ocean  floor. The tunnel was oxygen deficient (about 9)  and had an IDLH atmosphere.  Employee #1 and Employee #2 of the five-person crew (one from each contractor)  died of lack of oxygen when the respiratory devices they were using  malfunctioned.                                                                  
819888, Employee Drowns While Commercial Diving , During a commercial dive  Employee #1 was installing a sewer lateral. He  drowned in approximately 8 ft of water. He lacked training and was using  improper equipment.                                                             
202422416, Employee Catches Finger Between Pole Rail  Later Amputated , At approximately 9:00 a.m. on July 8  2013  Employee #1  with 4 Granite Inc.   was attaching a light pole (14 ft tall and 2.5 in. in diameter) to a new  guardrail that had been installed on top of a 13 in. high concrete curb. The  light pole was a plastic pipe with two lights  4 square ft  held 3 ft apart  and angled out to a total width of about 76 ins. It weighed approximately 125  pounds  and its center of gravity was estimated to have been about 9.5 ft from  the bottom. Two brackets made from angle iron had been welded to the  guardrail. One bracket was at approximately 29 ins. above the ground  and the  other was at approximately 53 ins. above the ground. Two holes were drilled  into each bracket to accommodate a U-bolt to hold the light pole in place.  Employee #1  and a coworker  lifted the light pole up into place  and Employee  #1 installed the upper U-bolt. The bottom of the pole was on the outside of a  piece of electrical conduit. The pole had to be lifted up over the conduit so  the wiring could be attached. Employee #1's supervisor told Employee #1 and  his coworker to wait while the supervisor got some wood blocks to rest the  pole on  in order to raise the pole into the proper position before attaching  the lower U-bolt. While the supervisor was gone  the coworker attempted to  lift the light pole up and over the conduit  so that it would rest in between  the conduit and the wall. The coworker used a 4 ft crowbar to lift the pole up  at its base. The coworker held the pole with one hand and held the crowbar  with the other. Employee #1 was reaching out over the coworker's shoulder to  give him room to work and was holding the pole with one hand to steady it.  Employee #1 did not have control of the pole. Each employee thought the other  was in control of the top-heavy light pole. When the coworker pried the pole  up  it rotated counter-clockwise around the upper bracket. Employee #1's right  thumb was caught between the pole and the upper rail of the guardrail.  Employee #1 suffered an avulsion (skin torn off to the skeleton) to the pad of  his right thumb. He underwent surgery to amputate a portion of the right  thumb. This accident was caused by the misjudgment of a hazardous situation   specifically  attempting to use a crowbar to lift a tall  top-heavy light  pole. Secondary factors were poor body positioning for the task  and a lack of  proper communication between Employee #1 and the coworker about who was  supporting the pole.

He was a qualified person for the work  and had placed the ladder hooks on the aerial strand wire. A TV coaxial cable  had been attached between the aerial strand wire cable and the house. This  coaxial cable was held under tension and created an outward pressure on the  ladder. Employee #1  who was on the ladder  cut this coaxial cable  which  caused the ladder and the aerial strand wire to move outwards and away from  the house. Employee #1 lost his balance and fell from the ladder because of  this movement. He struck the ground and sustained fractures to his left arm   left pelvis and left ankle. Emergency medical personnel were summoned.  Employee #1 was transported to a medical center. At the hospital  he underwent  surgical procedures; afterwards  he was hospitalized for postoperative  treatment.                                                                      
201129475, Employee Is Injured When Struck By Aerial Boom Lift , At approximately 8:55 a.m. on September 12  2012  Employee #1  acting as a  spotter for a coworker who was operating an aerial boom lift  was struck by  the lift's right front wheel. The coworker was driving the lift when he lost  sight of Employee #1 who either stopped walking or walked into the path of the  moving lift. Employee sustained fractures to his right fibula  right heel  and  right and left ankles. Employee #1 was taken to Kaiser Hospital in Santa  Clara  CA and was hospitalized. Upon further investigation  it was determined  that Employee #1 failed to communicate to the coworker by hand gesture or  verbal means for either his intention of walking into the lift's path or as a  signal for the coworker to stop the vehicle. Both Employee #1 and the coworker  held current certifications as boom lift operators and were experienced with  safety requirements for operations at the jobsite.                              
200515625, Communication Tower Worker Is Killed In Fall , At approximately 5:50 p.m. on June 26  2012  Employee #1  of Midwest  Steeplejacks  Inc.  Fargo  ND  was working with Coworker #1 on a 300-foot  telecommunication tower in Solway  MN. They were pathing the tower's  communication dish with another communication dish located on a  telecommunication tower in Bagley  MN  where Coworkers #2 and #3 were working.  The task of pathing involved the sending and receiving of microwave signals  between the two dishes to align and adjust them so they communicated more  effectively. Both dishes had been installed previously. Employee #1 was  wearing an ExoFit XP Tower Climbing Harness equipped with a positioning device  and twin lanyards. Witness interviews obtained from the Beltrami County  Sheriff's Department indicated that Employee #1 was using only one tie-off  point when he unhooked his positioning device to reposition himself at a  different location on the tower. He fell feet first approximately 153 feet.  Employee #1 was pronounced dead at the scene.

He sustained a strain of his left upper arm and shoulder and contusions  on his face  scalp and neck in the fall. Employee #1 was transported to a  medical center. At the medical center  Employee #1 underwent treatment  after  which he was released from the hospital. A causal factor in the accident was  that the ladder was placed on the eave  at the natural low point of the roof;  however  the metal gutter prevented the use of ladder locks on the roof  which  result in the top of the ladder not being secured.

202528303, Driver Is Caught And Killed In Gunite Truck Auger , On July 21  2010  Employee #1 was a permanent employee working for a concrete  company as the driver of a gunite truck. The company had been contracted to  install a swimming pool and spa in Ft Myers  FL. Employee #1 had delivered  gunite material  a combination of sand and cement mix  to the location. A  four-person team was also at the accident site to spray and shape the gunite  as it was dispensed from the gunite truck. The crew was positioned forty to  sixty feet away from the truck; they last saw the driver heading toward the  truck with a shovel. Although the truck was empty at the time of the accident   the crew's supervisor assumed that the driver was going to the truck to bang  the shovel against the sides of the bin. This act would have loosened any sand  that had become stuck inside on the wall of the bin. It was often done by  drivers  but only from the outside. Minutes later  the supervisor released one  of the crew members to see if the driver needed assistance. The truck was  empty  and no product was being dispensed by the truck. The crew member  arrived at the truck but could not locate the driver. The truck's auger  which  was still in operation at this time  made it difficult to hear. The crew  member remained at the rear of the truck waiting for the driver. It was at  this time that he noticed a piece of clothing being expelled from the auger.  He quickly turned the truck off and immediately notified his supervisor. The  shovel was found on the top edge of the sand bin undamaged. The supervisor  found Employee #1 inside the truck's sand bin  caught in the 9-inch auger  located in the bottom of the bin. The supervisor called emergency medical  services. The driver was alive when he was extracted from the auger  but he  died on the scene while being attended to by emergency responders due to leg  amputations. The mobile gunite truck was a 1989 International industrial truck  which contained two bins. One bin held sand  and the other held cement mix.  The truck had a 9-inch diameter auger  17 feet  7 inches in length  which ran  through the bottom of both bins. The auger transferred sand from the sand bin  to the cement mix bin. The two materials were combined and sent to another  auger  the mixing auger  located at the rear of the truck. The mixing auger  was located outside the truck bins. It extended 9 feet  9 inches in the rear  of the truck. Although there was a ladder located at the rear of the truck   the only time it was used was when the driver visually inspected the load to  ensure that a full load was received when material was being loaded into the  truck. The loading area was located at the employer's establishment in Cape  Coral  FL. The mobile gunite truck had several warning labels posted on the  outside of the truck warning of the dangers of the auger  including serious  injury  amputation  and death. The driver had been employed eight months. He  had received guidelines and training on driver responsibilities on November  20  2009.

202612206, Water Well Drill Worker Fractures Hand And Wrist , On July 1  2010  members of a crew working for Pacific Coast Drilling were  driving casing down into a predrilled hole. This operation required the use of  an H-fork or wrench inserted into a tool joint on a drill rod. While the  operator was moving a control lever in an up-and-down motion to push the  casing down into the hole  his stomach contacted the rotation lever of the  machine he was running. This contact made the rod and fork rotate. The  rotating H-fork caught a driller helper's left hand between the mast of the  rig and the fork. The driller helper sustained a crushed hand and wrist. An  emergency crew responded  and the employee was airlifted to Stanford Hospital.  
200651636, Employee Fractures Leg When Pinned By Piling , At approximately 2 p.m. on August 18  2009  Employee #1 and the other  team-workers finished setting the last of eight pilings into a template. They  were going to cap that piling and drive it. They would then proceed to the  East and drive all eight pilings. They were set at the end in the 15-in. to  16-in. slots or squares of the template and they were 14-in. in diameter. A  0.5-in. thick wall rounded the pilings. They had length of 28 ft to 36 ft. The  template slots or squares were supported about 10 ft above the creek by two  seahorses  which footings were set on the rocky creek bed. The crew was trying  to align the last piling held in the crane-suspended driving rig  to begin to  cap it. The crew was having some difficulty aligning this piling. They moved a  shift to the West and released the piling from the driving rig. When it was  released the whole template and all of the pilings tipped over to the West.  Employee #1 was thrown from the rig and pinned by pilings in the creek bed.  Employee #1 fractured his femur and was hospitalized. The other worker was  thrown to the pilings shore  and he sustained only minor bruises and  scratches.

14194252, Employee Burned By Hot Tar , Two employees of an asphalt manufacturing plant were required to make repairs  on the screen deck area of the plant. An employee pulled the circuit breaker  for the screen deck area and locked the control panel housing the circuit  breaker. A second employee then started the plant to gain access to the screen  deck area. Operation of the control panel was turned over to a contractor  employee who was to perform the preventive maintenance operations on the  control system. The contractor employee activated the system. The control  system had not been properly deenergized and the control panel began to  display erratic readings. The asphalt production system interpreted the  erratic readings as an indication to produce more asphalt  exceeding  manufacturing capacity. Molten asphalt began to flow from the storage  container into the weigh bucket. The normal operational capacity was 500 lbs  and the maximum capacity was 1100 lbs. The molten asphalt exceeded the maximum  capacity and began to overflow. At that time  Employee #1 was walking by the  area and was splattered by the overflowing asphalt. He suffered minor burns on  his head and face and was hospitalized.                                         
202588984, Worker Falls Into Trench And Injures Neck , At approximately 3:00 p.m. on December 3  2013  Employee #1  an apprentice  laborer employed by Diablo Plumbing  Inc.  and Coworkers #1 and #2  managers   were working at a multi-employer work site  the construction of the Stoneridge  Creek Skilled Nursing Facility. Employee #1's employer was subcontracted to  Segue Construction  Inc.  the general contractor  to install underground  plumbing and related plumbing trenches. The employer's workers had excavated a  relatively shallow sewer trench  approximately 2 feet 6 inches deep. They then  set the pipe in the trench. Their work progressed toward one end of the site   while another contractor followed behind to excavate a deeper trench and  install in it the electrical utility. Employee #1 was instructed by Coworker  #1  a manager  to drop back to areas where the sewer pipe had been recently  installed and to tape plastic sleeving for corrosion protection to the 4-inch  sanitary sewer riser. Due to the configuration of site utilities  there were  several locations where the sewer and electrical trenches crossed. One of  these locations was Grid Line 8  between Grid Lines M and N  where the  electrical trench had been excavated crosswise to the sewer trench and  approximately 3 feet from the sewer riser. The work was scheduled so that the  excavation activities of the two trades were not physically conflicting.  Employee #1 worked safely within the sewer trench  installing the plastic  sleeving. He then exited the shallow trench to retrieve more tape. He climbed  out of the sewer trench at the corner where it intersected with the deeper  electrical trench. The corner broke off  and Employee #1 fell into the deeper  electrical trench  a fall height of 7 feet. Although Employee #1 climbed out  of the trench on his own  he was gasping for breath. Coworker #2 came over and  evaluated Employee #1. Coworker #1 called for an ambulance after Employee #1  lost consciousness. The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department responded and  transported Employee #1 to the hospital  where he was admitted and treated for  bruising to the neck. This event was reported to Cal/OSHA by the employer at  approximately 3:00 p.m. on December 3  2013. It also was reported by the  general contractor and the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department. During  Cal/OSHA's subsequent investigation  it was determined that Diablo Plumbing  was a plumbing contractor that performed work on a wide range of both  residential and commercial projects  including related excavation work. The  investigation report concluded that the employer had failed to reevaluate the  trench conditions when the situation changed. The top edges and corners of the  trench were beveled in many places from drying and cracking and/or minor  sloughing. Where the newer  deeper electrical conduit trench was excavated at  right angles to the sewer trench  the drying reentrant corners where the  trenches met constituted a new hazard to Employee #1  who was working in one  of these areas. The employer had failed to train Employee #1 to recognize and  avoid this new hazard. The investigation found that Employee #1 could have  avoided the new hazard if he had walked further away from the deeper  electrical utility trench before exiting the shallower sewer trench.            
202510087, Power Line Worker Is Injured In Fall From Utility Pole , On September 21  2013  Employee #1  an electrical technician employed by OC  Communications  Inc.  was engaged in power line work.

201186483, Electrician Is Injured When Struck By Falling Equipment , At approximately 11:04 a.m. on June 7  2012  an electrician at a work site in  San Francisco  CA  was facing the northeast direction with the power  disconnect of a tower crane in front of him. He was kneeling down while  working on the balonga cords of the power disconnect. A 46mm socket and  extension fell from the crane and struck him in the back  near the right  shoulder blade. He was evaluated by the onsite first aid personnel. He refused  treatment from the San Francisco Fire Department. At the time  he was able to  rotate his right arm 360 degrees with discomfort. The following day  June 8   2012  the employee was not feeling well. He called into work and was told to  go to an urgent care facility. He was admitted to St. Francis Memorial  Hospital and treated for broken ribs and a punctured lung. The accident was  reported to the San Francisco District Office of Cal/OSHA by the employer   Decker Electric Co Inc. Electrical Contractors  San Francisco  CA  at 2:26  p.m. on June 11  2012.                                                          
201955184, Employee Electrocuted By Temporary Wired Power Cord , On August 3  2007  Employee #1  of BrenMar Construction  Inc.  was at the P.  H. Glatfelter Company to repair the fan on the boiler. He was to use a 460/575  volt  three-phase  Miller XMT304 portable arc welder  serial #LA284630  which  his employer had brought to the site. However  the welder was not equipped  with a plug. A BrenMar supervisor at the site consulted with a Glatfelter  supervisor  and they decided to have a Glatfelter maintenance person wire a  plug onto the welder's power cord  which was common practice at many host  facilities  including this site. Glatfelter actually provided a cord known to  be compatible with their outlets and within the voltage range of the welder.  The Glatfelter maintenance worker wired the plug to the cord but  unknowingly   wired the grounding conductor to one of the hot terminals  and a hot one to  the ground terminal. The maintenance worker did not plug in the welder. When  the welder unit was plugged in  Employee #1 touched the frame of the welder  and was electrocuted. According to Brenmar  Glatfelter and to Miller Electric  Manufacturing Company  which manufactures the unit  the equipment power cord  can be wired with any plug that is compatible with the outlets available at  the worksite  provided the plug is within the rated voltage of the welder.      
310810320, Employee Cuts Thigh While Using Skill Saw , On July 3  2006  Employee # 1 slipped back on a skill saw cord  placed on top  of forks of a forklift.

The worker could not  complete the cut because the power cord became tight and did not have enough  slack to allow the saw to be pushed completely through the cut. Employee #1  placed his left hand behind the saw cut to hold the two pieces and released  the pressure on the saw trigger. This allowed the saw blade to bite into the  remaining wood. The saw kicked back and injured three fingers of Employee #1's  left hand. He was hospitalized.                                                 
200811172, An Employee Was Electrocuted , Some employees were using a wet-dry masonry saw to cut brick during  construction of a residence. The employees had previously complained about  receiving electric shocks while using the saw and complained that the saw was  not running properly. The ground in the work area was wet from recent rains.  The employees drove a piece of 10-millimeter-diamter metal rebar   approximately 610 millimeters long  into the ground to a depth of about 100  millimeters. They then wrapped one end of a short section of #12 copper  conductor around the rod and attached the other end to the metal frame of the  saw. However  the saw still did not run properly. An employee unplugged the  saw to troubleshoot the problem. After the saw was thought to be fixed  an  employee picked up the attachment plug for the saw and the cord connector on a  cord set to connect them. He received an electric shock and fell face down in  a pile of bricks. The employee was transported to the local hospital where he  was pronounced dead on arrival. He had been electrocuted.                       
200604395, Electric Shock , A plumber was using a 120-volt electric drill to bore a tunnel under the  concrete foundation of a house. As he was working  he was lying on an  extension cord set supplying the drill. After he had been working for about 30  minutes  a coworker found him unresponsive. He had been electrocuted.           
200997914, Worker Is Electrocuted While Installing Water Meter , On August 26  2009  Employee #1  a journeyman plumber with L.S. Plumbing &  Heating  was replacing a water meter in a hotel crawlspace. While accessing  the crawlspace  he used a trouble light that was missing its ground prong and  had a cut in its cord. When the exposed wiring hit the water in the  crawlspace  Employee #1 was electrocuted.                                       
200555639, Employee Is Killed In Fall Through Floor Opening , On April 23  2009  Employee #1  a pipefitter  was assigned to check a 2-in.  spool section that was located above the preflash deck in the new crude unit.  It had an extension cord wrapped around it  giving the impression that the  cord may have been securing the pipe to a vertical support member. Upon  accessing the preflash deck  Employee #1 stepped away from the ladder. He fell  through an open hole in the decking  that was within 2 to 3 ft of the ladder   40 ft to the ground and died.

They had  been using a DeWalt Roto Hammer Drill plugged into a yellow extension cord  that extended from the lift to the concrete floor and across to a spider box  located approximately 30 ft away. Coworker #1 backed a forklift away from the  lift  made a Y-turn and proceeded forward. He heard Employee #1 and #2  shouting  turned his head to look behind him and saw the lift falling over.  Coworker #2 turned around and saw the yellow extension cord tangled up in one  of the forklift wheels. Employees #1 and #2 rode the lift to the ground and  were hospitalized with multiple fractures.                                      
201353448, Employee Dies After Electric Shock From Faulty Cord , On September 25  2007  Employee #1 was using a refurbished  double insulated  Bosch Rotozip saw  model 4351  to cut holes in the sheetrock ceiling of a  residential home under construction. The cord of the tool had an inadequate  splice in it. The tool was plugged into a 120-volt extension cord which was  plugged into a power strip. The power strip was connected to a series of three  extension cords that went to an outlet located in the house next door. The  outlet was equipped with a ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI). The  extension cords between the power strip and the outlet were missing their  grounding pins. Employee #1 wrapped the extension cord that powered the saw  around his neck so that the plug where the power tool was connected was  resting on the left side of his chest. It was a hot day  and he was sweating.  A witness heard Employee #1 yell  and saw him throw off the tool and cord. He  then stepped off the plastic bucket upon which he was standing  took two  steps  and collapsed. Employee #1 never regained consciousness. He was  transported to a local hospital  where he was pronounced dead. The electrical  shock he received was not enough to leave burn marks on his body  but it was  enough to disrupt the rhythm of his heart. The medical examiner's report  listed the cause of death as acute cardiac dysrhythmia due to low voltage  electrocution.                                                                  
202446605, Carpenter Sustains Fractures In Second, At approximately 8:39 a.m. on April 26  2007  Employee #1 was working as an  exterior carpenter for a framing contractor. The firm had 1 000 employees  and  he was a regular employee. At the time of accident  Employee #1 was using tool  such as a Skilsaw to cut blocks to make a wall on the second floor of a  residential home. He was positioned about 3 feet from the edge of the second  floor  10 feet 7 inches above the ground level in the kitchen area. The  extension cord connected to the saw was stuck  so Employee #1 pulled on it.  When he did  it came loose  and Employee #1 lost his balance. He fell onto a  concrete floor and sustained multiple fractures. He was hospitalized.           
201179736, Employee Electrocuted While Plumbing In Crawl Space , Early in the afternoon of August 24  2006  Employee #1 was engaged in plumbing  work in a crawl space under a house. He was dragging a light attached to an  extension cord with him when he was electrocuted.                               
201038403, Employee Electrocuted By Damaged Extension Cord ," At 10:59 a.m. on August 16  2006  Employee #1 was installing concrete forms  for a driveway at a house in Long Beach  CA. The house belonged to the owner  of a residential construction contracting company that had hired Employee #1's  employer  an unlicensed contractor  to build the driveway. While he was  working  Employee #1 contacted live electrical wires from a damaged yellow  extension cord that was attached to a Dewalt corded electric drill. A coworker  heard him call for help  grabbed the cord  and pulled the drill out of his  hand. Employee #1 then collapsed into a fetal position  clutching his chest  and moaning. The construction company owner heard the commotion and came to  help; he started CPR and his wife called 911 for assistance. Employee #1 could  not be revived; he was transported to Community Hospital of Long Beach  where  he was pronounced dead. Subsequent investigation determined that the yellow  extension cord had bare metal conductors showing at its female end  which was  attached to the drill. The cord's male end was missing the ground plug  as was  the orange extension cord to which it was connected. The orange cord was  plugged into an exterior GFCI-protected outlet. The GFCI outlet showed  ""correct"" wiring  but it did not trip under load or when the TEST button was  pressed.                                                                        "
200052660, Employee Shocked By Extension Cord While Reversing Polarity , On January 12  2006  Employee #1 and a coworker were cutting the concrete in  an existing structure in preparation for installing additional plumbing as  part of a renovation project. The workers were using a 480-volt AC concrete  saw powered by a truck-mounted generator. Employee #1 was alone  setting up  the equipment  while his supervisor discussed the cuts to be made and their  locations with the general contractor. While testing the saw  Employee #1  realized that the polarity was reversed and he decided to correct this by  changing the cord. He disconnected the saw cord from the extension cord  running to the generator. Employee #1 was supposed to re-wire the de-energized  side of the cord  the saw cord  but began to disassemble the generator side of  the cord while the generator was running. As he was working  he contacted a  277-volt single phase of the three-phase cord and sustained third-degree burns  to the middle fingers on both hands. Employee #1 was transported to the  hospital  where he was admitted for treatment. Subsequent investigation found  that the previous job had involved an incorrectly wired 480-volt power source;  this was a common occurrence at some of the construction sites where Employee  #1 had performed concrete-cutting operations  and it was easier to reverse the  wires in the cord than to wait for the electrician to arrive and correct the  polarity issues within the circuit. At this site  they were using the  company-owned generator  which was correctly wired.                             
202126678, Employee Is Killed In Fall From Roof , On August 24  2010  Employee #1 was applying an acrylic roof coating on a  building roof  when a section of the roof gave way because of corrosion.

201405628, Employee Dies In Fall Through Roof , On June 13  2001  Employee #1 and other employees were replacing a roof. The  aged metal sheets were exposed. Employee #1 stepped on the deteriorated metal  sheeting  and the weakened metal collapsed under his weight. He fell 52 ft to  the ground. He died of injuries sustained in the fall.                          
14331524, Employee Killed When Aluminum Reflector Collapses , On the morning of September 30  1992  Employee #1 was part of a three-man crew  that was taking down an aluminum reflector angled at 45 degree from the  vertical at the top of a 275-foot high microwave relay tower. They were  replacing it with a receiving/transmitting dish. Employee #1 had to go into  the aluminum framing  which supports the reflector and secures it to the  tower  to attach the bridle sling for a tag line used to keep the reflector  and framing from hitting the tower while it is being lowered to the ground.  While out in the reflector framing  the employee must attach his safety belt  lanyard to the framing rather to the tower. Employee #1 was on the reflector  framing when the bolts at the top securing bracket sheared  and the top of the  unit began peeling away from the tower  pulling the bottom bracket off the  tower. The reflector unit and Employee #1 fell to the ground  where he died of  massive head and trunk trauma. The brackets  nuts  and bolts securing  reflector framing to the tower had been checked before Employee #1 went into  the framing and appeared to be normal. The company had a contract to perform  this work on a series of microwave relay towers and had already done several  without a problem. However  this particular tower was located adjacent to the  Gulf of Mexico and the corrosive effect of salt air on aluminum and steel  brackets secured with aluminum nuts and bolts had not been considered. This  corrosion was not detectable without disassembly of the brackets.               
201086774, Employee Is Burned By Uncontrolled Release Of Acid , On August 25  2005  an employee and a crew consisting of a supervisor  an  operator  an operator's assistant  an emergency hoseman  was tasked to clean  out a blocked pipeline system carrying 93Sulfuric Acid. All crew members  donned the following chemical resistant personal protective equipment: two  piece body protection  gloves  boots  face-shield  and hard hat. Lock out-Tag   line isolation  pump shut down and pressure relief procedures were followed  and approved with CalPine's oversight. Line blockage was found to be in a  vertical section  where the high carbon steel line was connected to stainless  steel line by a threaded union. As employee applied pressure with two pipe  wrenches to loosen the coupling  the pipe cracked  releasing acid under head  pressure. The acid was deflected under the employee's face shield contacting  him on the lower left side of his face and neck. The employee was drenched by  emergency hoseman and subsequently removed to an emergency shower. The  employee was taken to Kern Medical Center  where he was treated and released  for second degree chemical burns. The following day examination revealed  excessive swelling  and the employee was referred to Grossman Burn Center   Sherman Oaks  CA  for inpatient hospitalization. A line blockage and  structural deterioration was found to be due to corrosion of piping as a  result of water contamination in the acid system. Previously  this operation  was performed without incident on two other acid systems. There was no visible  condition identified to suspect the pipe was subject to failure. Preoperation  planning and procedures were determined to be adequate. There was no evidence  which suggests injuries sustained by the employee were the result of  violations of Title 8 Safety Orders.

The crane operator was not familiar with the controls of the  crane. The operator did not know the weight of the load  and did not know the  length of the boom. The crane was overloaded when the accident occurred.        
202483863, Employee Is Electrocuted When Boom Contact Power Line , On June 16  2009  an employee and a coworker had finished loading a trench box  onto the bed of a truck crane. The employee was securing the trench box with a  chain when the boom contacted a 7620 volt power line  causing him to be  electrocuted.                                                                   
200122976, Crane Operator Receives Minor Injuries In Crane Tipover , At approximately 3:30 p.m. on November 17  2008  a crane operator was  conducting a boat lift at a marina in the Kinnickinnic River in the port of  Milwaukee  Wisconsin. The ground on which the crane was set up consisted of a  loose stone base and concrete. The left rear outrigger was positioned on loose  stone and double-span blocked on wood timbers. The right rear outrigger was  blocked on a single set of wood blocks at the edge of the boardwalk. The right  front outrigger was set on concrete with wood outrigger blocking stacked and  spanned. The left front outrigger blocking was set on concrete with wood  blocking double-stacked and spanned. The pieces of wood used for blocking were  not uniform. Although the site had been examined before the crane's outriggers  were extended into place  the soil under the concrete on which the right rear  outrigger was positioned had eroded. The erosion over time created a void in  the soil  and as the third boat was lifted  the concrete in this area cracked.  The crane then tipped over into the river. The operator rode the crane into  the river and managed to escape from the cab before the crane went underwater.  He broke out a glass window in the cab and swam free of the crane. He was then  pulled from the water by coworkers. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that the  operator was taken to the hospital for examination and observation. Injuries  were limited to bruises and minor cuts. He was not hospitalized. The injury  line says the crane operator received no injuries. During an inspection of the  lift site after the accident  a sink hole or erosion point behind the seawall  was noticed about 150 feet to the southwest of the lift area. It was also  visible from the lift area. This should have initiated further inspection of  lift area to quantify the ground capacity and stability conditions. The crane  operator indicated that he was not sure if the spreader bar was certified  before operation. He also indicated that it was assembled on the site and  weighed about 2 500 to 3 000 lbs.  but he was not sure of its weight. The  erosion of the soil was a primary contributing factor that caused the loading  on the crane to transfer to a dynamic load. Once the crane's capacity had been  exceeded  the crane tipped over into the river.

Unknown to the crane operator  the  crane's computer had been configured in the ""Jib Out"" mode. During the first  lift of the counterweight from the flatbed truck  the crane's computer kicked  out. The crane operator was able to set the counterweight down and lifted a  second counterweight  causing the computer to kick out again. The operator had  to immediately set the counterweight down on top of another counterweight   without properly seating it to the counterweight underneath  leaving it in an  unstable position. The crane operator was not familiar with the crane's  computer and was not able to determine what was wrong with the crane. The  company's job superintendent (an iron worker) got up into the crane and was  able to determine that the cranes' computer was not properly configured for  the boom configuration being used (""Jib In Stowed Position""). The job  superintendent was able to reconfigure the computer  and Employee #1 and his  coworkers continued off-loading the crane parts from trucks arriving at the  site. Before off-loading more counterweights  they attempted to reposition the  last counterweight off-loaded. Employee #1 and a coworker set the hooks at the  end of the rigging to the counterweight lift points. Employee #1 positioned  himself between the counterweight being lifted and counterweights that were  previously off-loaded (approximately one foot of space). Employee #1 gave the  signal to the crane operator to begin tightening up the rigging to set the  hooks. The crane boom was not centered over the load and when the crane  operator began to boom up  one hook set  raising the counterweight to a height  that allowed it to slide and rotate. Employee #1 was crushed between the  counterweight being lifted and other counterweights that had been stacked  behind him. As soon as the crane operator saw what happened  he repositioned  the counterweight and emergency services were called to the scene. Employee #1  was transported to Coffeyville Regional Medical Center and was subsequently  air evacuated to St. Johns Regional Medical Center in Joplin  Missouri  where  he died from his injuries.

202530556, Worker'S Foot Is Crushed By Extending Outrigger , On October 26  2010  Employee #1 was working for a firm that installed traffic  lights. On the day of the accident  he was part of a crew that had been sent  to the intersection of the Harbor Freeway and Gaffey Street in San Pedro  CA.  They were there to install a traffic post with an arm where the lights were  going to be attached. The crew had brought with them a truck-mounted crane.  The post and the arm of the traffic light post were on the bed of the  truck-mounted crane. After the traffic control equipment was set in place  the  crew lowered the arm to the ground. Since this activity required the use of  the crane on the truck  the supervisor extended the outriggers of the vehicle.  At the same time  Employee #1 was focusing on inserting the sling on the arm  that was to be lowered. Accordingly  he was unaware that he had walked into  the side of the truck adjacent to the area where the outrigger was being  positioned in place. Although there was a beeping alarm  Employee #1 did not  hear it. The outrigger on the rear passenger side of the truck came down on  Employee #1's left foot. He was hospitalized for three days and underwent  surgery for his fractured toes.                                                 
200802528, Employee Jumps Out Of A Collapsing Crane , On September 28  2010 Employee #1 was working with a crew performing the  reroofing of a commercial flat roof. The employees were using a Boom Truck  Crane to remove material from the roof. Employee #1  the crane operator  was  removing a stack of insulation from the roof to the ground. Employee #1 swung  the load from the roof to an area for storage. Before he could get the load to  the ground  the front right outrigger failed and the crane collapsed. Employee  #1 was able to jump from the crane before it collapsed he suffered no  injuries. The crane was removed from the site and recycled for parts  it was  no longer usable. The company had never conducted an annual or monthly  inspection of the crane.                                                        
202502779, Employee Injured In Jump From Deck When Crane Overturns , On January 23  2008  Employee #1  a crane rigger  and five coworkers were  unloading and staging equipment along the shoulder and wooded hillside of  eastbound I-70 (mile marker 14-1/2)  in preparation for work on the culvert  under the highway. The temperature was approximately 30 degrees F  with a  10-12 mph wind  no precipitation  and clear visibility. The hillside had a  slope of approximately 3-in-1. At 9:00 a.m.  the left-hand lane and shoulder  were closed to traffic. A company-owned 30-ton Manitex boom truck crane  with  an hydraulic telescoping boom  model 30102C  serial #134978  was set up on the  left side of the roadway and shoulder  in the same direction as the flow of  traffic. The traffic lane was 12 ft wide and the shoulder was 2 ft wide  with  a standard guardrail. The crane operator attempted to lift 20 to 30 sandbags   each weighing 50 lb  in a rebar cage  for a total load weight of approximately  1 000 to 1 500 lb. Two 10 ft long  2 in. wide nylon straps were used for  rigging. Employee #1 was on the rear deck of the boom truck as the lift  commenced. In the middle of the lift  the boom truck tipped over onto the  driver's side  landing on the guardrail. The crane operator jumped and crawled  in the space under the truck and Employee #1 jumped off of the deck onto the  roadway. Coworkers  hearing trees snapping and seeing the boom falling over  the hillside  ran for cover. Employee #1 was treated for scrapes on his  elbows  and for bruised and swollen hands. He did not miss any days of work.  The boom angle was 48 degrees  and the boom was fully extended to 102 ft   positioned over the driver's side  over the front outrigger  and parallel with  the cab. The outriggers were used  but not pinned  and their exact position  could not be determined due to extensive damage. With the outriggers fully  extended  the total width needed to set up the crane was 22 ft; the crew used  only approximately 14 ft of space. They used the front stabilizer bar  and  placed cribbing under all the outrigger pads. The crane operator conducted a  daily inspection of the crane.                                                  
202454237, Employee'S Arm Fractured In Fall When Crane Overturns ," On December 26  2007  Employee #1 was operating a P&H; Lattice truck-mounted  boom crane  model #9150  serial #51529. He had completed work at a tilt-up  panel commercial construction job in Monrovia  CA  and was dismantling the  crane for travel. Previously  he had unmounted a rear counterweight and set it  on a flatbed truck on one side of the site. This was necessary because the  crane had become stuck in the mud that formed after several days of heavy  rain. To remove the counterweight  the crane had been jacked up and plywood  placed under the wheels to free the crane. Employee #1 then moved the crane to  the other side of the site to unload a spreader bar and associated rigging  onto another flatbed. He did not set the outriggers before starting this job.  Employee #1 then tried to ""get a better look"" at the position of the second  flatbed truck  which apparently had pulled up farther than he had anticipated.  He started to swing the crane to the left and also to boom up on the tires  when the crane began to tip. Employee #1 attempted to jump free of the crane  as it was going over and suffered a fractured right arm. He was transported to  Huntington Memorial Hospital for treatment. Employee #1 later stated that he  felt he had been in error because he should have set the outriggers before  starting the task underway at the time of the accident.                         "
201380987, Employee Killed When Struck By Crane Boom , At approximately 12:52 p.m. on October 31  2007  Employee #1 was working as a  spotter for the removal of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping at the bottom of an  aerator basin. The truck crane onsite was staged above an unleaded tank. The  right rear outrigger of the crane broke through the asphalt  causing the crane  to lean to the side. This resulted in the telescoping boom striking and  killing Employee #1 on the walkway.                                             
202360582, Two Are Hurt When Crane Moving Highway Camera Pole Tips Over ," On February 26  2007  Employees #1 and #2  along with their foreman   constituted a crew of three employees employed by the private sector  transportation infrastructure firm Midasco  LLC. They were working northeast  of Baltimore  Maryland  near Kenwood Avenue and the Baltimore Beltway. The  crew had removed a 30-foot high steel camera pole at an interchange and had  secured the pole onboard a Ford National crane truck. Because a portion of the  pole was extending past the end of the truck  a safety vest was tied to the  end of the pole. The crew took the pole to the State Highway Administration  communication repair facility (""radio yard"") at 5901 Baltimore National Pike   where they arrived around 1:30 p.m. Checking with the State Highway  Administration employees  they were instructed to place the pole next to a  previously placed pole up against the fence on the east side of the yard. The  crew foreman assigned the other two employees to set up the crane truck and to  unload the 30-foot-long steel pole. The pole weighed between 900 and 1 000  pounds. The truck was brought into place  and the straps were removed from the  pole. The crane's hook was unlatched and the pole was attached to the straps  and the crane hook. While this was going on  a State Highway Administration  truck with two employees inside drove into the yard; its driver asked the  crew's foreman a question about the camera that had been removed from the  pole. The foreman was standing at the driver's side of the State Highway  Administration truck with his back to the crane truck  about 25 to 30 feet  away from the crane truck. The crane operator  who was Employee #1  had  lowered the outriggers on the passenger's side of his crane truck  and the  landing pads were in place. The outriggers were lowered on the driver's side  but without the pads. None of the four outriggers was extended at all. The  crane operator raised the crane's boom and then the pole up and off the truck.  The groundman  who was Employee #2  was holding onto the safety vest tied to  the end of the pole to help steady the pole and to guide it to the storage  location. The pole had to travel up and over numerous fiber reels of various  sizes  some of them as high as 6 feet  3 inches. As the pole went over one of  the fiber reels  it contacted the reel  scratching the thumb of the groundman  and drawing blood. He let go of the safety vest  and the pole bounced. He  looked at his finger and started walking around the fiber reels to grab the  safety vest again. As he did  he noticed that the crane truck was tipping  over. He yelled to the operator to get off the truck. The operator jumped from  the bed of the truck  landing on his feet. The foreman and the State Highway  employees ran over to see if Employees #1 and #2 were alright. Employee #1   the crane operator  sustained bruises  contusions  and abrasions on his legs  in the jump from the truck. Employee #2  the groundman  sustained a laceration  on his finger. Neither employee sustained any further injury as a result of  the overturning of the crane truck  and neither was hospitalized.               "

200271484, Crane Tips Over , On September 19  2005  Employee #1 and coworkers were moving epoxy-coated  rebar with a load weight of approximately 5 400 pounds. The rebar was  positioned into place using a Lorain LRT 230E Rough Terrain Crane. When the  crane was setup  the outriggers were not fully extended  as a result the crane  was not operated within the limits and specifications determined by the  manufacturer. The crane became unstable during the operations  causing it to  tip over. However  no employees were injured in the accident.                   
201125721, Crane Operator Avoids Injury When Crane Tips Over , At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 13  2005  an employee was working with  a small crew of men  moving steel beams from the ground to a highway overpass.  The employee was operating a hydraulic boom crane  and was lifting a 50-ft  long steel beam weighing approximately 5 400 lb. This exceeded the safe  working load for the crane. As the load was raised off the ground  the crane  tipped over on its outriggers  and fell from the overpass to the ground below   destroying the crane. The crane operator survived with minor cuts and did not  require hospitalization.

The operator did not position one of the  outriggers and the crane tipped to its side. The operator sustained  lacerations to his leg and elbow when he fell from the crane  but was not  hospitalized.                                                                   
202587267, Employee Dies In Fall From Forklift , On February 13  2012  an employee was standing in a wooden crate while lifting  a rubber hose  full of grout material  to an elevated position on a nearby  scaffold. The wooden crate was elevated by placing the wooden crate on the  forks of a rented forklift. The wooden crate was not secured to the forks of  the rented forklift. The hose was being manually carried by the employee while  he stood in the wooden crate. The employee's position on the elevated wooden  crate  in addition to the weight of the rubber hose full of grout  caused the  elevated wooden crate to become unstable. This condition resulted in the  employee falling off the crate and onto the ground below him. The employee's  face impacted the surface on the ground. The wooden crate hit the ground near  the employee and it tumbled onto the employee. The crate ended up resting on  top of the lower half of the injured employee's body. The distance of the fall  was 7 feet 6 inches. The height of the guard rail on the wooden crate that was  used to elevate the injured employee was found to be 32 inches. The employee  was taken to the hospital for emergency care. The employee died shortly after  his arrival at the hospital. Due to the circumstances associated with this  incident  the Division issued an accident related serious citation related to  failure of the immediate employer to ensure that the wooden crate was secured  to the forks of the forklift  in such a manner as to prevent the wooden crate  from tipping over. Another accident related citation was issued concerning the  height of the guard rail on the wooden crate. The height of the guard rail was  measured to be 32 inches. The regulations required that the height of the  guard rail on the wooden crate should have been 42 inches.

200359289, Electric Shock , Two plumbers were repairing broken pipes in a crawl space under a residence.  The homeowner opened the house to allow the employees to enter  and then the  homeowner departed. The crew had determined on the previous day that the crawl  space presented little space to work in and that the ground in the crawl space  was wet. Consequently  they decided to use hand tools only. There were five  177- by 355-millimeter vents around the crawl space perimeter. The workers  made sure that the crawl space vents were open and clear. One of the workers  entered the crawl space with a manual tubing cutter and a flashlight. (Both  battery-powered and cord- and plug-connected electric tools were available on  the work van.) He removed sections of plastic water line nearest the crawl  space entry  which was 787 millimeters wide and 330 millimeters high  and  moved further under the house. The two employees kept a running conversation  as the first employee made his way into the crawl space. After the first  employee had been inside the crawl space for approximately 7 to 8 minutes  his  coworker went to the van for additional parts. When the coworker returned to  the house  he heard the first employee screaming and thrashing about from an  electric shock. The coworker called his office to request emergency medical  services and then entered the crawl space to reach the injured employee. When  he grabbed the injured employee's boot  he found that the injured employee was  trembling  but unresponsive. The coworker cut a hole in the kitchen floor to  reach the injured employee. However  when emergency medical services arrived   the emergency medical technicians pronounced him dead. He had been  electrocuted.

14407316, Employees Suffer Possible  Unconfirmed Exposure To Cyanide , At about 1:50 p.m. on October 15  1994  employees of Fluor Daniels (F/D)  the  maintenance contractor for Rohm and Haas  were removing an I-beam used as a  monorail for a hoist in preparation for replacing a 100% hydrogen cyanide  (HCN) tank. It had been reported that the N-5 unit was shut down  but it later  was found that the 2nd stage was recirculating while waiting for crude ACH  from the N-3 unit. The 100% HCN tank  next to which the F/D employees had been  working  had been washed 11 times since the Thursday before the incident. At  about 1:50 p.m.  a F/D pipefitter read 13 ppm on his personal monitox (cyanide  monitor)  so he went to the control room  where an operator checked the area  with a Drager HCN detector tube. Hydrogen cyanide was not detected and another  monitox was given to the pipefitter. Employees were told that they could  continue working. At about this time a pipefitter helper began feeling dizzy.  About 20 minutes later  the 2nd monitox indicated 161 ppm cyanide  and the  pipefitter took it back to the control room while the other F/D employees left  the area. At this point  the pipefitter began feeling very ill  coughing up  blood and experiencing difficulty breathing. Rohm and Haas used detector tubes  to check the area again for HCN  but it was not detected. The alarm was never  sounded because detector tubes and the perimeter monitoring system indicated  non-detection during the incident. The pipefitter was showered in the  emergency shower and taken by ambulance to Southmore Hospital. His coworkers  then went to the change house for showers. There  two of the coworkers became  ill. Later  other F/D employees became ill. Belmont Construction Services  employees had been working primarily in the KP area  which was shut down so  there was no methyl methacrylate present. By 6:00 p.m. some of their employees  had become ill and passed out; some of them became ill on the bus that took  them from the Belmont area to the contractors' gate. Fifteen Belmont employees  were taken to the hospital and 13 stayed overnight for observation. In  addition  one Rohm and Haas employee and one Laidlaw employee  who had been  working in the West Waste Treatment Plant  were hospitalized. Overall  34  employees from the four different companies were affected. Medical tests for  Belmont  Laidlaw  F/D  and Rohm and Haas employees all returned normal. The  employees who left the plant site and were taken directly to the hospital were  reportedly tested for cyanide in the blood within 20 minutes of the onset of  known symptoms. Later tests could not substantiate a cyanide exposure  but  some employees' doctors stated that the employees had been exposed. The  weather that day consisted of heavy rain and 100% humidity. The monitoxes were  sent to the manufacturer  who said that water was inside them and that they  could not find traces of HCN on the monitoxes. An outside operator stated that  she had had her monitox fail high after getting it wet or dropping it. The  manufacturer's operating manual specifies operating limits of 20 to 95%  relative humidity. The Drager detector tubes also have a relative humidity  range of less than 80%. Employee interviews indicate that no one smelled or  tasted cyanide or anything else  except that the union representative stated  that some of the Rohm and Haas employees could smell 81R from the semi-works  next to N-5.

The two workers were  installing decking panels for the first floor pour.  with work progressing  from east to west. Employee #1 was standing on the completed portion of the  decking  handing panels to the carpenter  who was standing in the form work of  a floor beam. The carpenter would then place the panels on vertical shoring  located on the west side of the beam. The completed decking had been installed  according to the manufacturer's drawings  but the vertical supports holding up  the panels adjacent to the floor beams were about 18 in. away from the form  work for the floor beams. This left an unsupported portion of decking  extending past this support point. Realizing this  the general contractor had  painted a heavy white line parallel to the floor beam where the panel support  ended and had intermittently painted ""NO STEP"" along the 18 in. strip.  Employee #1 inadvertently walked into this area and the panel flipped up   causing him to fall 16 ft into the basement. He suffered multiple injuries  that left him paralyzed on his left side.                                       "

200376028, Employee Is Electrocuted While Replacing Power Pole , On May 23  2012  a five man crew (2 linemen  2 operators  and 1 foreman) was  working replacing electric distribution power poles with one neutral line and  two power lines with 4800 volts at Old Number Six Highway in Santee  South  Carolina in the right of way between the house and the wood line. The crew had  set three poles that morning and had two remaining poles to set to complete  their work for the day. The crew set pole Number Four for the day and the two  linemen framed (completed setting hardware and the cross arm) the pole after  it was set. The two operators and foreman were working on the ground framing  out the last pole to be set that day. The end of the pole being framed was  elevated by the boom on a derrick/digger truck that was sitting parallel to  the power lines with its boom at a 90 degree angle so that it was directly  under the power lines. The derrick/digger truck was not grounded. The two  linemen  in elevated buckets  had completed moving the neutral line up from  the old pole to the new pole that was approximately five feet taller than the  old pole. They had also installed the new single arm on the new pole (the old  pole had a double arm). The linemen were beginning to move both of the primary  lines individually yet simultaneously. The primary line closest to the woods  broke at a splice and fell. The part of the line that was in a rubber  insulating boot landed directly on the boom of the derrick/digger truck. The  tag end of the line that fell came to rest next to the pole that was being  framed under the lines. There were a couple of spots on the ground wire (that  had been installed on the pole) that had abrasions and possible burn marks  as  well as other hardware on the pole that was to be used to hang the  transformer. Employee #1  who was standing on the woods side of the pole that  was being framed  was electrocuted and died during the accident.

The two linemen were on the west side  of the pole in a bucket truck holding the static (ground) line. Employee #1  was on the ground pushing the pole to center it in the hole  and Employee #2  was shoveling sand in the hole to backfill around the pole  while Employee #3  walked toward the pole after plumbing it with a string and plumb bob. One of  the employees told the foreman that the pole needed to be centered more  so  they raised the boom of the digger derrick. As they pushed the pole over and  began to lower it back into the hole  the pole came in contact with the top  west energized line  which caused a flash and loud boom. Employee #1  #2 and  #3 sustained burns and were hospitalized for their injuries.                    
200375483, Load Line Breaks And Injures Worker , Coastal Electric Cooperative (an electric utility) and Sumter Utilities (an  electric power contractor) were installing new utility poles along a highway.  An engineer working for the utility went to a jobsite to observe the  installation of poles by the contractor. Contractor employees were using a  Terex Telelect Commander 4000 digger-derrick mounted on a Marsh Buggy (Model  No. WMB50402416PC) to set and remove poles. The workers had positioned the  marsh buggy at a bridge. When they were removing an old pole  the vehicle   facing east  stuck in the muddy marsh. The workers tried to get the vehicle  turned to the north so that they could more easily extract it from the mud. To  rotate the vehicle  they used the turret-mount winch on the digger-derrick   securing the winch's synthetic rope around a small tree stump and running it  under a steel bar welded between the pontoons on the front of the vehicle. The  workers turned the vehicle  but it slipped back into the rut as the workers  started moving it out of the mud. The rope broke and struck the engineer on  the left and right forearms and hand. A superintendent for the contractor  drove the injured employee to a hospital. He was hospitalized for 3 days for  lacerations to his forearms  a fracture in his left hand  and the prevention  of infection. (The tree stump had been cut  and the rope removed from the  winch before the inspection  so they could not be examined.)                    
314709346, Electric Shock , An equipment operator for an electric utility was working alone  operating a  highway hydraulic-pressure digger. He was digging four holes for new utility  poles for a new overhead power line. He used the digger to dig three of the  holes and went to the location for the final hole. This location was directly  under a 17.6-kilovolt overhead power line. The worker sat in the operator's  station at the back of the truck bed operating the controls and raising the  boom. The lowest overall working height of the digger was 6.6 meters  and the  maximum sheave height was 9.1 meters  based on a 1-meter chassis-frame height.  The overhead line was 8.2 meters above the ground. The digger was facing down  an incline  and the worker's upward line of sight was obstructed by a  factory-installed umbrella. As the worker raised the boom  it contacted the  power line  energizing the truck. The worker got off the truck without  incident  but was electrocuted when he contacted the digger's auger and fell  onto an outrigger. A grass fire started near the truck after it became  energized.

He was installing an elevator attachment device at the top  portion of a drill collar. The basket did not have rails at the area used to  attach and separate collars and pipes. While in the basket of the derrick   Employee #1 leaned forward to install the elevator to the collar. He wrapped  his right arm around the collar and had his left hand on a rope that was  around the collar. He pushed the collar with his right shoulder and dropped  the rope from his left hand. The momentum and weight of the collar caused  Employee #1 to lose his balance and fall forward. He grabbed the elevator with  both hands while both his feet remained on the basket for approximately 15  seconds. His feet slipped off the basket  and he hung from the elevator by his  hands. Employee #1 hugged the top portion of the collar  as he slid down  approximately 50 ft. His hands slipped off the collar  and he fell  approximately 70 ft to the steel surface of the derrick. He was killed.

201580982, Employee Electrocuted When Derrick Boom Contacts Electric Li , On April 30  2007  Employee #1  an apprentice  and coworkers were setting up a  new wood pole for a 7200 kilovolt distribution line. They first drilled the  hole with the insulated boom situated under the lines and at full extension.  The crew then retracted the boom fully  making it uninsulated  and began to  unload the replacement pole from the truck. While maneuvering the pole  the  signalman allowed the boom to violate the approach distance of 25 in. The  operator started to boom down and before the signalman could react  had  touched one phase line. The operator immediately boomed back up  breaking the  conductive path. At the moment of contact Employee #1 was moving around the  truck to help the signalman. He was apparently trying to steady himself while  climbing over a pallet of power cables  and had one hand on a grab bar of the  truck and the other hand on a metal garage door. The electrical current  entered the palm of Employee #1's left hand and exited through the fingers of  his right hand. He was able to take one or two steps and respond to a question  before collapsing. Coworkers and the responding paramedics administered CPR   but Employee #1 died.

They had been at a construction site a few blocks away  and their truck was  parked 30 ft away and parallel to a power line. While they were waiting for  the concrete truck to arrive  Employee #1 told his coworker  who was sitting  in the driver's side of the truck  that he was going to set up the outriggers  on the truck. After they were in place  Employee #1 began unfolding the boom   which struck the 14 400-volt overhead power line. The coworker  seeing that  the truck was on fire  got out and began walking to the rear of the vehicle.  He told Employee #1  who was standing on top of the truck  that he had struck  the power line. Employee #1 dismounted and joined his coworker in back of the  truck. At some point he tried to enter the vehicle again and was electrocuted.  
200513844, Employee Electrocuted When Boom Contacts Power Line , At approximately 7:50 a.m. on September 7  2005  Employee #1 was part of a  three-man crew installing earth anchors at the base of an overhead power line  pole. He inserted a metal anchor rod into the anchor wrench that was attached  to the boom on a digger/derrick truck. The boom was also in contact with an  energized 14 400-volt overhead line. Employee #1 was electrocuted.              
200623478, Employee Killed In Fall When Ejected From Aerial Lift , On June 20  2005  Employee #1  the foreman  and his five-man crew were  replacing a utility pole and moving energized 13.2-kilovolt  three-phase  distribution lines and de-energized 69-kilovolt transmission lines from the  old pole to the new one. Employee #1 had hung guides from an aerial lift and  was descending when part of the boom near the hinged section struck a tree.  Employee #1 was ejected or bounced out of the lift basket and fell between 50  and 60 ft. He was killed. Employee #1 was not wearing a body belt/harness with  a lanyard attached to the boom or basket.                                       
170710859, Employee Killed When Struck By Stabilizer Legs , On September 19  2003  Employee #1 and two other journeymen lineman were in  the company's work yard  preparing to leave Connecticut for Maryland for storm  duty coverage following Hurricane Isabel. They were clearing out equipment and  materials from the belly of their utility truck  including a used electrical  capacitor. Employee #1 got into the bucket of an aerial lift that had the  controls for a winch  and  after one coworker secured the capacitor  he lifted  it out of the truck. The third crew member sat in the truck throttling the  engine because the throttle switch in the truck's rear was not working.  Employee #1 placed the capacitor on the ground near a storage trailer. The  coworker disconnected the winch and Employee #1 returned the bucket and winch  to the cradle of the truck. The coworker then went to raise the two stabilizer  legs on the driver's side using hydraulic controls on the rear driver's side  of the truck. When that was done  the coworker moved to the stabilizer  controls at the rear passenger's side to raise the two passenger side legs.  After starting the process  he looked toward that side of the truck to ensure  that nobody was in the way and saw Employee #1 lying  facedown  on the  blacktop pavement. He yelled for help and coworkers came running. The coworker  rolled Employee #1 onto his back to administer first aid. At the time  he was  breathing and had a pulse. Employee #1 was transported to Norwalk Hospital   where he died.                                                                  
362363343, Employee Burned In Utility Pole Electric Flash , On June 23  2003  Employee #1  a lineman  and three coworkers were placing new  12 kilovolt conductors on utility poles in Anaheim  CA. The existing  equipment  which had 12 kilovolt circuits  needed to be reconfigured to  accommodate the new conductors. Employee #1 was in an International bucket  truck with a Versalift bucket assembly  while one of his coworkers  a  fifth-stage apprentice  worked with hot sticks and rubber gloves on the east  side of the pole opposite the bucket. Existing conductors had been placed  vertically instead of in the usual horizontal manner  so the work involved  moving the street side  neutral 12 kilovolt conductors to the field side pole  pin position. The neutral 12 kilovolt line had an unwanted crimp splice  connector sitting atop the insulator  so Employee #1 pulled off this connector  and clamped down the neutral line in the insulator. He then told the  apprentice coworker to climb down  since this particular job was completed.  The other coworkers  a groundman and the foreman  were also on the ground.  Then  for some reason  the material handler load indicator contacted the  energized phase  and a bucket control knob contacted the neutral wire   resulting in a phase-to-neutral flash. Employee #1 sustained second- and  third-degree burns over 35 percent of his body  primarily his upper torso.  Subsequent investigation revealed that at some point the insulating line hose  covering the field side phase had been removed. Employee #1 was also supposed  to be wearing rubber gloves  but his apprentice coworker was not sure if this  was true.                                                                       
202311403, Electric Shock , A local utility company hired an electrical contractor to install new  streetlighting at the corner of a hazardous intersection. The job required  installing one of the streetlights parallel to an existing 13.2-kilovolt  (phase-to-phase) overhead power line. The ground worker installed the  streetlighting hardware and supply cable on the pole  placed a synthetic nylon  sling with a choker hitch around the pole  and attached the sling to the load  line of a derrick truck. When the derrick lifted the pole to an upright  position  the derrick's tilt-pole plumber arms grasped the shaft of the pole.  The operator of the derrick truck swung the load around and began to set the  pole in a 1.8-meter-deep hole. The ground worker was securing the cargo straps  to the pole trailer as the derrick operator was setting the pole. When the  butt end of the pole contacted the bottom of the hole  the pole spun the  streetlight into the overhead line. The ground worker ran to the pole to try  to prevent it from contacting the overhead line. He was electrocuted when he  touched the supply cable on the pole. He had entry and exit wounds on his  right hand and right heel.                                                      
201360757, Employee Killed When Crushed Between Backhoe Bucket And Boom , At approximately 4:00 p.m. on March 17  1999  Employee #1  of Carbo Inc.  was  directed by his employer to accompany a friend of the employer who needed  assistance extracting a Caterpillar 416-C backhoe that had become stuck in  soft ground on a highway shoulder outside of Morgan City  MS. The employer's  friend had left the South Fresh Farms Maintenance Shop on his company's leased  Caterpillar and had been headed north to help the employer load diesel truck  engines onto a flatbed trailer. While traveling the 2.8 miles into town on the  mostly gravel and dirt farm-to-market road  the friend saw some standing water  near the east shoulder of the road. He stopped and began to use the backhoe's  4 yard front loader bucket to cut a drainage swath in the soft road shoulder.  The friend customarily maintained the road in this way  primarily so trucks  hauling catfish for South Fresh Farms would not get stuck. As he was working  on the drainage swath  the backhoe's right-side wheels became stuck in the  dirt. The friend then hitched a ride into town to summon help from Employee  #1's supervisor  who owned an International winch truck which he used in his  house moving business. Employee #1 was directed to take the winch truck and to  help pull the backhoe out of the ditch. Before beginning the extraction  the  friend had to balance the backhoe by shifting the bucket to the right. After  the machine was pulled out of the ditch  the friend said he needed to move the  backhoe attachment's boom and bucket to allow Employee #1 to unhook the winch  line's tail chain. When the friend pulled the backhoe's bucket in toward the  boom  he heard a crunching sound. Employee #1 had become caught between the  backhoe bucket and the boom. He was crushed and killed. Employee #1 had moved  between the boom and the bucket instead of waiting for an appropriate signal  that it was safe to do so.                                                      
14408223, Electric Shock , A power line crew was replacing a broken utility pole. One of the employees on  the crew was standing on the side of the digger derrick  holding onto the side  of the truck with both hands. A second employee was reaching into the cab of  the truck with his right knee touching the running board. The ground was wet  from a rain and ice storm. As he was positioning the boom of the derrick  the  operator brought the boom into contact with a 13.2-kilovolt overhead power  line. The employee at the side of the truck was electrocuted. The employee  reaching into the truck received an electric shock and burns on his knee and  foot. He was hospitalized for his injuries.

As the employee was descending  he grabbed a lacing that was not adequately  secured  causing him to lose his balance  and fall striking other coworkers as  he falls approximately 25-ft to the ground. The employee was wearing fall  protection equipment  but was not properly tied off. Employee #1 was taken to  an area hospital  where he was treated for blunt trauma  rib fractures  and  spinous process fracture. Employee #1 remains hospitalized.                     
202553491, Employee Is Injured In Fall From Pole , On October 10  2011  Employee #1  with an electrical subcontractor  was  descending a pole. When he reached the pole steps at the communication level   he disconnected his pole choker fall restraint device. As Employee #1 swung  around the pole from the high side to the lower side (approximately 12 in. out  of plumb)  his gaff caught on a section of ground molding. He then lost his  balance and fell approximately 20 ft to the ground. Employee #1 was  hospitalized for abrasions and bruises.                                         
202543559, Employee'S Ankle Is Fractured In Fall From Ladder , On October 3  2011  Employee #1 was working for his employer  a Rebar  installer  at a jobsite in Los Angelis  CA. Employee #1 was descending a  job-made ladder that was placed inside an excavation  and the top of the  ladder began to move. Employee #1 turned around to rebalance himself  and he  decided to quickly walk down the ladder  before it fell down. As he was  walking down the ladder  his foot got caught in the space between the rungs   located at the bottom of the ladder. As a result  Employee sustained multiple  fractures to his left ankle  and he was hospitalized. Contributing causal  factors were that the ladder was not secured to prevent movement and that the  ladder did not have three points of contact during Employee #1's descent. It  was determined from the accident report that the incident occurred at 10:00  a.m.                                                                            
14273452, Employees Injured By Unplanned Detonation , Some employees were excavating a hole for an electric light pole. They had  drilled two holes and loaded them with two to five sticks of 40 percent  dynamite. They were using a 6-volt battery to detonate the dynamite when an  unplanned detonation occurred  injuring both employees. They were hospitalized  for their injuries.                                                             
201034204, Employee Injured When A Punch Press Actuated , At approximately 5:00 p.m. on February 26  2002  Employee #1 was working as an  operator in Punch Press No. 3C-3  locaed in the stamping shop of the facility.  The shop uses punch presses for forming Toyota truck body parts. The machine  under consideration is a 300-ton capacity press with 12 to 16 strokes per  minute  manufactured by Shimomura Press Manufacturing Company of Japan   machine model number DCLP-300-22E. The punch press is a part revolution  machine with emergency stop pushbuttons installed at five locations including  at both hand pushbutton panels. Pressing one of these buttons causes the slide  to stop immediately. In order to ensure the safety of the operator during the  downward movement of the slide  the machine is designed to require the use of  both hands to press the pushbuttons continuously until the slide reaches the  lower dead point. The machine works two shifts every working day and it makes  about 12 different Toyota truck body parts. At the time of the accident   Employee #1 was working by himself. The employee had been working in this  machine for four years. While changing die for stamping fuel tank upper part  number 7711102100  Employee #1 pressed the two (hand) pushbuttons and the  slide went down. As he released his hands  the slide/die eventually went up.  Employee #1 leaned forward (across) to reach the air ejector valve for making  some adjustments. At that time  the slide came down (for the second time) and  struck his right elbow. This amounted to 'double cycling' without actuating  the hand push buttons. According to Employee #1  this feature happened a few  times in the past. Employee #1 was a regular employee of TABC  Inc. Employee  #1 was hospitalized in the Long Beach Memorial Medical Center where he was  treated for an avulsion fracture of his right elbow  soft tissue loss  and  nerve damage. The investigation determined that no lockout/tag out procedure  was followed while adjusting the air ejector valve (during the die change  procedure).

The utility truck  now out of control  moved into the median and was struck  again in the rear by the truck. The truck then came around and struck the  utility truck a third time in the side. The truck continued south in the  passing lane  then crossed the median about 1 mile from the initial accident  and struck Employees #1 and #2  construction workers  as they worked in the  36-foot wide median. From there  the truck traveled across the northbound  lanes through traffic and down an embankment on the right-of-way. The truck  went through a fence and into a parking lot  where it struck a parked vehicle   knocking it into an office building before it also hit the building and came  to a stop. Employee #1 sustained serious head and internal injuries and died  at the hospital. Employee #2 received lacerations and bruises on his leg and  arm and was treated and released from the hospital.                             
202260600, Electric Shock , Some employees of an electrical contractor were using a digger-derrick to set  utility poles. While an employee was using controls located at the back of the  truck to position a pole in its hole  the top part of the elbow on the boom of  the digger-derrick came too close to a 13.2-kilovolt overhead power line.  Current arced to the boom  electrocuting the employee. (The truck also ignited  and burned.)                                                                    
200642148, Electric Shock , A four-employee crew was setting a new wood utility pole on a single-phase  overhead power line. The employees were using a digger derrick and an aerial  lift. They used the aerial lift bucket to place line hose on the phase  conductor and to pull the conductor out of the way. The operator of the digger  began lifting the pole with a load line  and the ground worker  who was  wearing leather gloves  was at the butt of the pole directing it into  position. The top pin on the pole contacted the uninsulated portion of the  phase conductor  electrocuting the ground worker.                               
200001238, Electric Shock , A power line crew was replacing a utility pole. They were using a  digger-derrick to set the new pole. The pole being replaced fell against the  extended boom of the digger-derrick  energizing the truck and electrocuting an  employee.                                                                       
200840684, Electric Shock , A crew of four power line workers  two journeymen  one foreman  and one  apprentice  was digging a hole to set a new utility pole for an existing  7200-volt overhead power line. Without protecting the power line from contact  by the boom  the employees used the auger on a digger-derrick to dig the hole  for the pole. After digging the hole  the auger was full of dirt and needed to  be cleaned before it was stowed. One of the journeyman power line workers was  using the controls on the side of the truck to operate the auger. He moved the  auger about a half meter away from the newly dug hole to provide clearance for  the apprentice to hand clean it. The apprentice used a metal-blade putty knife  to scrape the dirt from the auger. The boom operator raised the auger to make  it easier for the apprentice to reach the lower blade area. When the auger was  approximately 610 millimeters above the ground  the boom contacted the power  line  electrocuting the apprentice. He had not been wearing rubber insulating  gloves while he was cleaning the auger. The digger-derrick had not been  grounded.                                                                       
201360559, Electric Shock , A ground worker on a power line crew was retrieving a piece of copper wire  from the back of a digger-derrick truck. (He had earlier warned a coworker to  stay clear of the truck.) The hydraulic hose on the boom on the digger-derrick  contacted an 8000-volt overhead power line  and the ground worker received an  electric shock. Coworkers administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation until  emergency medical services arrived. Initial tests indicated that the injured  employee had some brain activity  and no liver or kidney damage. Further  testing later that day indicated that the employee had no brain activity  and  he was pronounced dead.                                                         
202288270, Employee Fell From Truck And Struck Head On Pole , A four-person power line crew was replacing one pole of a two-pole spar-arm  electric transmission structure. The crew was using a Telelect Commander II  digger-derrick truck to remove the old utility pole. The pole had been  disconnected from the structure and had been cut off in sections  with the  butt end still in the ground. One of the employees was at the boom control  station  which was located to the side of the lower portion of the boom. The  load line was wrapped around the pole. When the employee put tension on the  load line  the turret mounting bolts for the boom sheared  causing the boom to  separate from the truck. The operator tried to jump clear  but his foot  apparently caught on a portion of the boom. He fell head first to the ground   and his hard hat fell off during the fall. His head struck the new pole  which  was lying on the ground. He died of severe head injuries.                       
200260305, Electric Shock , A power line crew was installing an overhead power line in a rural area. One  of the power line workers was using a winch attached to a digger-derrick  positioned under the line to pull the last phase conductor of the line up to  the crossarm of a utility pole. The end of the conductor somehow twisted   causing it to point in a vertical position. The conductor went beneath the  insulating blanket covering a conductor on a nearby energized line and  contacted the energized line. This energized the digger-derrick  electrocuting  an employee leaning against it.                                                 
200052017, Employee Injured By Chemical Burn From Potassium Hydroxide , On December 29  2002  Employee #1  a maintenance worker  jumped into a tank  containing 18 000 gallons of potassium hydroxide. The tank was part of a  13-tank dip tank system used in the manufacture of heavy farm machinery. An  unguarded  elevated catwalk ran between two of the 18 000-gallon tanks. The  tanks were serviced by an overhead crane hoist that moved parts in and out of  the tanks. As the crane or hoist traversed the catwalk in its lowered  position  there were only a few inches of clearance between the crane  mechanism and the catwalk. Employee #1 had to make an adjustment to a spray  nozzle on one of the tanks. He made an internal calculation that he had enough  time to run out on the catwalk and make the repair before the crane or hoist  traversed the catwalk again. He misjudged the time he had. While making the  repair  he turned around and noted that the crane was upon him. Employee #1  had only a split second to determine what to do. Employee #1 stated that he  felt his only recourse was to jump into the tank in order to avoid being  struck and pinned by the crane or hoist. Employee #1 was hospitalized with  chemical burns.

The pilings were to protect the employees from  cave-ins. Initially  the operator would hold up each piling with the trackhoe  bucket  while Employee #1 put it into place. Then  the trackhoe would be used  to push the piling into the mud. As the operator maneuvered the trackhoe to  get it into position  the bucket came into contact with a high power line that  contained 7 620 volts. Employee #1 came into contact with the sheet piling and  was electrocuted.

The  employee was working alone on the site grading a pad to pour concrete on so  that a house could be erected. Employee #1 was receiving multiple truck loads  filled with dirt  and he was using a Dozier to level out and then compact the  dirt using the compactor before the next loads of dirt arrived. The pad was  approximately 62-ft by 113-ft long with a sloping grade from front to rear of  pad. The pad was roughly 22-ft high at the rear of the pad. Employee #1 was  operating the compactor the length of the pad from front to back. The employee  had been operating the compactor for an hour when the compactor throttled went  down on its own towards the end of the pad. The vibrator function on the  compactor was still engaged tamping the ground. Before Employee #1 could turn  off the vibrator  the ground began to give way causing the compactor to slide  sideways and begin to roll over onto its side. Employee #1 who was wearing his  seat belt  as is company policy  unhooked the seat belt and attempted to jump  to safety by leaping in the direction that the paving compactor was falling.  The employee hit the ground and before he could get up to run  he was struck  by the roll over protection on the compactor and pinned underneath the machine  for approximately one hour before a passerby heard him screaming for help.  Employee #1 turned off the paving compactor vibrator by using a marker stake  that was next to him and using it to depress the on/off switch. The machine  ran for approximately 20 minutes before the engine locked up on the machine.  Emergency Medical Service transported Employee #1 to a local hospital  where  he was treated for a broken pelvis  legs and damage to the urethra. Employee  #1 remains hospitalized.                                                        
201167228, Laborer In Excavation Is Overcome By Exhaust From Compactor , On August 31  2005  Employee #1 was working as a laborer for a general  engineering company. The company had been contracted to construct a parking  lot behind a strip mall in Los Angeles  CA. The construction of the parking  lot involved a vertical cut of a hillside and the placement of a retaining  wall. The vertical cuts were achieved by a slot cut method designed by an  engineer. Employee #1 was assigned to prepare one of the slot cuts for  backfilling at the completion of the construction of the retaining wall. He  was working with a gas-powered compactor in the excavation (the space behind  the retaining wall  in front of the vertical cut). As he was using the  compactor to compact the soil  the compactor malfunctioned and started to buck  and smoke. Employee #1 was being overcome by the smoke. He turned off the  compactor and called for assistance. Coworkers lowered a ladder to him and  helped him out of the excavation. Emergency medical services were called  and  Employee #1 was taken to Sherman Oaks Hospital. He was evaluated  treated for  smoke inhalation  and released on the same day. He was not hospitalized.

The trench  was not protected from cave-ins by the use of shoring systems or sloping  equipment. The trench collapsed trapping the employee at the thighs. Employee  #1 was transported to shock trauma where he received treatment for injuries  and released.                                                                   
201118023, Employee Injured In Trench Collapse , At approximately 10:00 a.m. on July 15  2004  an employee was working with a  whacker in a trench. The trench was two-feet wide and approximately 7.5-feet  deep. A four-inch diameter plastic pipe had been laid in the trench and the  employee was using the whacker to compact the back fill dirt. When the trench  was approximately six-feet deep  a side wall near the end of the trench caved  in. This was dirt that had been previously disturbed. The employee was buried  up to his stomach. The closest slum shore was approximately eight feet from  the end of the trench. He sustained broken ribs and bruised lungs and had  problems with his breathing. The employee was hospitalized for nine days.

202614517, Employee Suffers Electric Shock And Falls From Ladder , On August 13  2012  Employee #1  with Jacks Overhead Door Inc.  was standing  approximately 15 feet up on a fiberglass extension ladder attempting to  service the control unit for an automatic overhead door. As he tried to adjust  a positioning interlock switch inside of the control unit  Employee #1  sustained a serious electrical shock and fell from the ladder. He was taken to  the hospital.                                                                   
200902609, Electrical Technician Is Killed In Fall From Ladder , On July 27  2011  a technician was working on the second floor of a newly  constructed two-story student campus building at a college in Brunswick  GA.  The technician was troubleshooting a malfunctioning chain-driven roll-up  (retractable) commercial overhead door. The roll-up door was one of four  similar new doors installed for use within the integrated fire door control  system of the building. The employee  working alone  had erected a fiberglass  8-foot A-frame stepladder and climbed the ladder to access the roll-up door  motor located in the ceiling space above the second floor corridor. The  corridor height from the carpeted floor to ceiling tiles was about 10 feet.  The employee apparently ascended the step ladder to about the fourth or fifth  rung from the bottom of the ladder for a work position  and removed a single  24-inch by 24-inch acoustic ceiling tile. He apparently then removed the motor  cover that enclosed the roll-up door motor. The 110V single-phase roll-up door  motor was energized at the time of the event  and at some point subsequent a  motor overload protector was activated. After removing the motor cover  the  employee apparently disconnected at least two of the low voltage (24 VDC) fire  alarm wires from the alarm terminals. He fell from his position on the ladder  to the carpet-covered concrete floor below. He was killed. There were no  witnesses. Medical examination(s) did not confirm any electrical shock or  electrocution injuries  and the cause of death was determined to be massive  skull fracture and trauma injuries from the fall. Investigation determined  that the ladder the employee had used had visible defects  including but not  limited to a bent right-side spreader bar  a broken left-side spreader bar  a  bent/damaged ladder rung  a large burn hole in the top of the ladder  missing  anti-slip pads on the ladder feet  and several cracks in the fiberglass side  rails. Items recovered at the scene and presumed used by the employee included  but were not limited to a small flashlight  a multi-meter  a phillips screw  driver  vice grips  and a small pocket knife. It was also learned that at the  time of the event the employee was talking on a cell phone to the roll-up door  manufacturer's tech support regarding the malfunctioning roll-up door and fire  alarm integration.                                                              
202469748, Employee'S Hand Struck By Door Attachment And Injured , On October 12  2010  Employee #1  a laborer  was working at a job site. A  supervisor instructed him to remove the metal framing and hardware for the  overhead rolling doors of a building. Employee #1 used a scissor lift to  elevate himself to the location of the metal framing and hardware attachments   which was at an approximate height of 10 ft above the floor level. The three  overhead doors were removed earlier in the day or on the day before. Using a  wrench  he removed the framing and hardware from one of the three door  openings without any problem. He then started to disassemble the hardware from  the second door opening by removing the nuts and bolt on one end of the metal  railing with the coiled spring inside. This railing spanned the width of the  door opening. He then loosened the nuts and bolts along the middle section of  the railing when the railing sprang off the wall with pressure. The railing  struck him on his left side and pushed him backward and down into the scissor  lift. He was wearing gloves and failed to realize that his left hand was  severely injured. Someone lowered the scissor lift because he was stunned and  could not respond. The metal plate at the end of the railing hit his left  hand. Emergency medical personnel were summoned. They arrived and transported  him to a medical center. He fractured his pinky and ring fingers  and  lacerated the left side of his abdomen. Medical personnel x-rayed his hand   dressed his injuries and administered intravenous morphine. The lacerations  were stapled  and he was instructed to return to another hospital the next day  for surgery on his hand. Employee #1 was released from the medical center the  same day. He then went to the other hospital. At this medical center  he was  admitted and underwent hand surgery  which involved the insertion of a metal  plate. After the hand surgery  he was hospitalized and released at  approximately 4 p.m. on the next day.

Employee #1 was moving the compaction roller over  uneven pavement to the job location at the top of an approximately 15 degree  grade. While doing so  the compaction roller steel drums began to spin  and  the compaction roller began to slide backwards. The compaction roller's front  and rear steel drums did not make full contact with the uneven asphalt  and  Employee #1 was not able to maintain control. Employee #1 jumped off the  roller and was caught and dragged underneath the compaction roller. Employee  #1 was hospitalized. Employee #1 suffered a fracture on the right side of his  face  multiple right-sided rib fractures  and the skin was completely torn off  the underlying tissues of his right forearm (degloved).                         
201185949, Employee'S Finger Is Amputated When Gloved Hand Is Caught In , At 6:00 p.m. on August 16  2011  the employee was performing his assigned duty  of oiling the auger drills on the future San Francisco Transbay Terminal site  as part of his job to construct a retaining wall using a NISSHA Phoenix Series  DH 658-135M auger drill. As the employee was using the auger drills  his  gloved hand was caught in the moving auger. His hand was dragged downwards   thus entrapping his finger. The employee was later taken to San Francisco  General Hospital. The employee suffered a partial amputation of the 3rd digit  on the right hand. The auger was not deenergized  locked  or tagged out. The  employer had no written and implemented LOTO procedures for the task  and  employees were not trained to lock and tag the machine out prior to such work.  
200210177, Employee Killed When Struck By Dragline Boom , At approximately 4:00 p.m.  Employee #1  a port captain  and coworkers were  was using a northwest 95 wt crawler dragline that had been walked onto a spud  barge to dig a wide space to virgin material through a boat basin where a  steel sheet piling wall was to be driven. At approximately 5:00 p.m.  the  operator was swinging the boom and digger bucket with material to be dumped to  the port side of the spud barge when he observed the barge was listing. The  spud barge was getting ready to be moved back when the operator of the  three-drum  air-driven winch also noticed that the barge was listing to the  port side. Digging ceased  and the deckhands checked the manholes near the  rake of the spud barge for water. Salt water was found in the port  compartments of the rake and along the port side. A 2 in. pump was secured  from the towboat  and the deckhands called the office for another pump.  Employee #1 brought a 3 in. pump and some gasoline. He then went back to the  yard and picked up another pump  another container of gasoline  and another  employee and returned to the boat basin bank. The port captain and the  coworker loaded the equipment onto the towboat and rode to the spud barge.  Once the three pumps were in operation  the spud barge began coming up.  Employee #1 instructed the dragline operator to walk the line back  approximately 10 to 15 ft and  while standing under the boom  gave the  dragline operator the signal to boom up. He turned around to face the rake of  the spud barge to watch for the digger bucket coming over the starboard  corner. As the boom was being hoisted  it suddenly fell and struck Employee #1  in the head  killing him. The boom came to rest on top of the rake of the spud  barge; the remainder of the boom was in the water with the digger bucket on  the bottom.

202544508, Worker'S Knee Is Fractured When Grinding Wheel Explodes , At approximately 2:15 p.m. on December 26  2012  Employee #1  of  Whiting-Turner Contracting Company  was working with three fellow employees  and several subcontractors to construct an addition to an existing hospital in  Los Angeles. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 were working in the second floor  courtyard of the hospital. They were assigned to remove cured concrete from  around a floor drain to permit the application of a water proofing material.  Coworker #1 had removed concrete with an electric chipping hammer  and  Employee #1 was about to smooth the concrete with a grinder equipped with a  6-inch flared cup stone grinding wheel. Employee #1 turned on the grinder  and  immediately the grinding wheel violently broke apart  causing stone wheel  shards to strike his knee. Employee #1 sustained lacerations and a fracture to  his patella. He required hospitalization and surgery to repair the fracture.  He was released from the hospital on December 27  2012. The employer reported  this injury to Cal/OSHA at 11:40 a.m. on December 27  2012. Cal/OSHA began its  investigation on January 7  2013. Investigation determined that the grinding  wheel was not effectively inspected to discover possible damage and that it  exceeded the maximum rated RPM of the grinding wheel. A serious citation was  issued for a violation of T8 CCR 3583(f) The inspection and mounting of  abrasive wheels.

Employee #1 accidently hit the forward  lever causing the excavator to move forward and crushing Employee # 2 right  leg and abdomen between the excavator tracks and the floor of the trailer.      
200925998, Employee Is Killed When Trench Collapses , On August 21  2010  Employee #1 and a coworker were connecting existing storm  drain lines to the new gutter system. Employee #1 was working in an 8-ft by  9-ft excavation trench and the coworker was working in the deepest trench that  was 24-inch wide by 8-ft long by 8.5-ft wide. The center wall of the  excavation collapsed and completely covered Employee #1  except for the  fingers on his right hand. He was crushed and killed.                           
202506879, Employee Fractures Ribs In Fall , On January 8  2009  Employee #1 was working inside a precast concrete drainage  vault to guide a concrete drainage inlet into place. As Employee #1 was  located on a ledge inside the vault  approximately 18 inches above the bottom  level  a loader operator lowered the drainage inlet into place. During this  process  Employee #1 lost his balance and fell  striking his left upper torso  against the fixed ladder rungs on the opposite wall of the drainage vault.  Employee #1 later requested medical treatment and was taken to a nearby  medical facility  where he was treated for fractured ribs.                      
202422192, Employee'S Hand Injured When Struck By Flying Plug , At approximately 11:00 a.m. on June 26  2007  Employee #1  a heavy equipment  operator  began operating an excavator after first inspecting the machine. He  had been mining and mucking for about an hour when he noticed a slow drip  coming from the right front port plug. Employee #1 pulled back and raised the  boom slightly to investigate it. At this time  Employee #1 did not notice any  significant damage to the plug  and the drip stopped when pressure was applied  to the cylinder. He called on the mine phone and spoke to his coworker  a  contractor at the site  who was at the bottom of an exit shaft  about 2 400 ft  back. He told Employee #1 that he would get a new plug. Employee #1 resumed  his work  moved the boom forward  and then was moving the boom either up or  down when the plug blew out. It struck Employee #1's left hand with sufficient  force to break off the left joystick and cause significant trauma. He was  evacuated from the tunnel and taken to the hospital  where he underwent the  surgical amputation of his left middle finger back to the wrist and the  relocation of his index finger to the middle position. After the accident the  plug was found to have been damaged  probably by rocks and boulders while  mining or mucking. The damage to the head caused the threaded portion to take  on an oval shape that was approximately 1/8 in. out of round. The full depth  of the threads on the ends of the oval were damaged consistent with the plug  being ejected. The threads on the sides of the oval were undamaged  indicating  that these were not engaged due to the shape of the plug after it was damaged.  While mining prior to the accident  the pressure in the hydraulic system  reached approximately 3 000 psi. The computer logs were not entirely clear but  showed that just before the accident the pressure was no more than about 1 600  psi. Why the plug did not fail during mining  and how a plug with most of its  threads not engaged only dripped slowly when under pressure both remain  undetermined. The accident occured during the excavation of an 11 mi long by  approximately 12 ft diameter tunnel. Excavation had been completed from the  portal to about 8 900 ft using a conventional rotary boring machine and drill  and blast methods. A digger shield-type tunnel boring machine was then  launched and had evacuated approximately 525 additional feet. The digger  shield TBM  built by CTS  Inc.  specifically for this project  utilizes an  excavator arm with a tooth attachment on its end to dig at the tunnel face.  Underneath the tooth is a flat shovel attachment or paddle that the operator  uses to pull muck onto the lower steel apron of the shield and onto the  conveyor belt. On each side of the arm are hydraulics that provide vertical  motion for the boom. On the upper part of each cylinder  angled outwards about  45 degrees are two ports for the hydraulic connections  one on each end.  Mirroring these ports  facing downward and outward  are unused threaded ports  that are plugged with 1.5 in. hex-head screws in steel plugs. When the  operator is mucking  the boom is pulled back toward him so that at the end of  the pull  the cylinder on his side is approximately 1 ft to his left. In the  fully down position  the front plug is about even with the operators left  joystick  both in height and position. There were no witnesses to the accident  and no citations were issued as a result of this investigation                  
202345187, Employee Drowns When Storm Drain Pipe Plug Fails , On May 6  2005  Employee #1 was at a jobsite  working for a construction  company that had been contracted to conduct site work  build detention ponds   and install underground utilities such as the storm sewer. He was working in  one of the junction pits. There  two incoming storm sewer lines were  connected. Their combined flow exited in one 60-in. line and went to the  detention pond. A plug had been installed in the exiting line (going into the  pond)  and the pit was pumped out so the work could be conducted. Employee #1  was in the pit holding a baffle in position while a coworker connected it to  the exiting wall of the pit. A failure occurred with the plug  causing a  explosive amount of compressed air to exit the pipe in the direction of the  baffle. The baffle pushed Employee #1 into the 60-in. pipe directly in back of  him. Immediately following the air blast  a tremendous amount of water flowed  into the junction pit  washing Employee #1 around two 90-degree turns. His  body was finally found approximately 150 feet from the original work area. He  had been killed.

201495967, Employee Struck By Falling Well Casing  Suffers Concussion , At midmorning on July 27  2011  two rig helpers were involved in the  installation of a deep well turbine pump in rural Madera  CA. Employee #1 was  a contractor employee leased through Clover Resource Solutions  Inc. Employee  #2 was an employee of Anderson Pump Company of Chowchilla  CA  the company  installing the pump. An elevator clamp failed  allowing a 20-foot section of  8-inch well case to fall and strike the two employees. Employee #1 suffered a  concussion. He was not hospitalized. This incident was reported on the same  day to Cal/OSHA Division by the Human Resources and Safety Director for  Anderson Pump Company. Investigation determined that a dual employer  relationship was created by contract between the primary employer  Clover  Resource Solutions  Inc.  and the secondary employer  Anderson Pump and  Machine  in accordance with the Division's P&P; C-1D. As reported  an elevator  clamp failed  allowing a 20- foot section of 8-inch well case to fall and  strike the two employees. The elevator clamp was a forged ferrous metal  clamping device for lifting 8- to 10-inch well casing. In this device  a chain  would allow for adjustment of the clamp in diameter to accommodate different  diameters and terminated in a two-fingered flange attached to a threaded rod  with nut. The fingered flange would fit into a saddle provided on the clamps  housing. Tightening the nut causes the device to clamp around the pipe   securing it for hoisting. Results of the visual inspection of the clamp  revealed a clean break of the fingers without an indication of cracking or  other indication of fatigue and failure. The threads on the adjustment rod and  nut did not show signs of deformation or galling. According to industry  sources  these clamps are common in the well drilling and service industry  although not currently in production. No requirement current or historical was  found to cause users to inspect or test these clamps for structural integrity.  Several other clamps were inspected with same results  that is  no defect was  observed. Several sources in the industry asserted they had never heard of an  elevator clamp failing. Although not conclusive  a possible explanation for  the clamp's failure was the fingers were not fully seated in the saddle   causing excessive load on the tips. Root cause of the injury event was  determined to be unforeseeable catastrophic failure of the elevator clamp. The  employer was found to have a well devised health and safety program with an  effective Injury and Illness Prevention Program  including employee training  and equipment maintenance.

202554218, Burn , At 1:40 p.m. on September 23  2011  Employee #1 was working for Corix  Utilities (US)  Inc.  an electrical contractor  at an industrial building  located in Fullerton  CA. He was installing new Edison meters to replace the  legacy meters on an existing electrical panel at an industrial complex. In an  interview  he related the details of the incident. Employee #1 had  successfully installed the first of three meters on a bank of meter switchgear  that was vertically arrayed. The meters were in a three-phase 480-volt system.  At 1:40 p.m.  he had scanned the first meter  using an MBLink mobile handheld  device to record that it was operable. Employee #1 next removed the second  meter and seated its replacement. He was placing the lock ring around that  meter  when he heard a humming sound. He immediately turned away  and an arc  flash occurred. It was the result of a phase-to-phase fault. He was thrown  back by the force of the blast. Because he had turned away upon initially  hearing the humming sound just before the arc flash  he sustained burns to his  ear and cheek. He watched as the electrical system continued to burn and arc.  He used his fire extinguisher to mitigate the ensuing fire before the  Fullerton fire department arrived on the scene. Employee #1 was wearing full  personal protective equipment (PPE) for electrical work: rubber insulated  gloves  leather gloves  long sleeve shirt  face shield  and safety glasses.  The arc flash resulting from the fault caused Employee #1 to sustain second-  and third-degree burn to the right side of his face and ear. He was treated at  an emergency room and released the same day. Employee #1 was a journeyman  electrician with IBEW local 47. He had over 10 years of experience working as  an electrician. He had worked full-time for the company replacing Edison  meters since July 2011. The company had written procedures for replacing the  meters  and they provided documentation of training the employee on those  written procedures. Further  Employee #1 confirmed that he was following those  procedures when the accident occurred. During the course of the worker's  employment  he had installed 35 to 40 new meters per workday without incident.  On the date of the accident  the employee had successfully completed 38  installations  with only two remaining for the day. It is unknown exactly what  caused the fault that resulted in the arc flash. The arc flash may  however   have been attributed to any of the following conditions: 1) the meter was  defective  2) a demand was placed on the load side during installation that  caused a surge  3) the meter was not properly seated into the meter socket  or  4) the employee made contact with the energized components with either a tool  or the meter's lock ring. There were no violations of Title 8  California Code  of Regulations found during the investigation.

201129921, Employee Is Burned When Hot Water Line Bursts ," At approximately 6:00 p.m. on Wednesday  June 19  2013  Employee #1 was one of  several workers installing a new sewer line for the city of Redwood City  CA.  The line was approximately 400 feet (122 meters) long and six inches (150  millimeters) in diameter. The workers were in the middle of a street. The  sewer pipe line was approximately 4 feet (1.2 meters) underground and ran  diagonally beneath the middle of Oakwood Street. Workers were using the  ""cured-in-place"" technique at this work site. This technique required that a  tube membrane material be inserted from a manhole and through the sewer and  then retrieved through the next manhole. The first step the workers performed  after preparing the materials was inversion; this process pushed the tube  membrane from one end of the sewer line to the other end through the  bombardment of cool water. The workers installed Enviroliners membrane  material securely in place within the sewer line from one manhole to the next  with cool water  flushing it for approximately one hour. Immediately  afterward  they began to flush it with hot water at a temperature of up to 150  degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius) at 5 pounds psi (34.5 kPa). The hot  water reacted with the polyester  vinyl-ester and epoxy resin in the membrane.  Hot water bombardment would take approximately up to three hours for the  chemical composition to react and to harden this membrane into a hard and  durable pipe material in order to maintain a constant wall thickness of a  pipe. It was done to create a durable  continuous  and smooth interior to  promote and improve strength of the 6-inch 150-millimeter) diameter sewer line  pipe. While flushing the membrane with hot water from a steam truck  Employee  #1 was adjusting the temperature controls from a truck that was right beside  the manhole. The narrative did not specify whether the controls were on a  second truck. The connection went from the hot water steam truck hose through  a manifold  using a sleeve connector  to the membrane  and then on to the  sewer line. At approximately 6:00 p.m.  the membrane area near the manifold  and sleeve connector burst open  and a few cups of hot water squirted out and  onto Employee #1  who was standing nearby. He sustained third-degree burns to  his left elbow  forearm  and left lower back. He cried out in pain and fell to  the ground. His foreman  who was nearby  saw what had happened and immediately  turned off the water flow from the steam truck. Employee #1 was taken to a  Kaiser-Permanente facility in Redwood City and then to St. Francis Hospital   where he received treatment for his injuries. Employee #1 was hospitalized  over 24 hours. The employer reported the incident to the Division the next  day. The Division opened an inspection fourteen days later  on July 3  2013.  At the time of this inspection  the foreman and other employees stated that  what had transpired was a typical day on the job except for the membrane's  bursting  which had never happened before. The foreman stated that the  membrane's bursting at low pressure was an anomaly and probably due to a  factory defect. The foreman stated that the membrane burst at its seams   because it was defective. At the time of the inspection  the membrane that had  burst had already been thrown away. No accident-related violation was issued.   "

200376135, Employee Contacts Power Terminal And Is Electrocuted , On October 10  2012  Employee #1  an electrician  arrived at a high school  sometime in the morning. He obtained permission to access the electrical room  and then drove behind the school to where the room was located. Employee #1  was onsite to replace the short circuit ratio (SCR) controller system board  and the photo board on a Kohler emergency backup generator. These boards were  within 9 in. of the exposed live current parts. The generator was set up in  Phase 3  power factor 0.8  kilowatts 33  kilovolt-ampere 41  amperes 50 and  factory test and reconnect F. Its model number was 33RZ272 and serial number  was 245558 and was setup in voltage of 277/480. The generator was operating in  normal operating limits with no problems. Employee #1 removed the positive  battery cable on the generator and turned the generator in the off position.  He then removed the front housing on the generator to access the area for  replacing the SCR board and the photo board. Employee #1 used a socket wrench  that was 7.5 in. long with a 2.375 in. deep well six-point socket to remove a  2.125 in. course thread bolt in the generator. As he removed the bolt  the  wrench contacted a live terminal from the rear switch on the generator  which  electrocuted him with approximately 277 volts. The incident occurred between  1:30 p.m.  the time he arrived onsite and 9:00 a.m. on the next day. The  assistant principal was on the kitchen dock  located behind the school  around  5:00 p.m. when he noticed Employee 1's company van still outside the  electrical room  but did not check on him at that time. The next morning  a  coworker called the school and spoke with the assistant principal  telling him  that he had not heard from Employee #1 since early the day before. The  assistant principal told the coworker to hold on while he went to the area  where Employee 1 was working. When he arrived on scene  he noticed Employee #1  slumped over on his knees with a reach still into the generator. At the point   the assistant principal called the school resource officer and school nurse to  the area. The resource officer instructed the assistant principal to have  power to the entire school shut down before removing Employee #1 due to the  concern that he was still energized. Power was shut down and he was removed  and power was restored to the school. From the investigation  blue wires were  found inside a closed electric box located 18 inches away. The blue wires went  outside and then underground to another building to power lights. These blue  wires on the hot side of the emergency lights breaker box created a back feed  to the generator  which would have caused the generator to be hot even if the  switches were in the off position on the generator. Black and white tape was  placed to insure no exposed wires were visible even in the off position.

201073277, Two Workers Burned In An Arc Flash ," On December 28  2007  an electrical outage was affecting a portion of the  building. Employee #1 and Employee #2 of Chula Vista Electric responded to the  site to troubleshoot and repair the equipment causing the electrical outage. A  worker led Employee #1 and #2 to an electrical room  where Employee #1 opened  the 4 160-volt 3-phase OFC switch device. The OFC switching device contains  three separate OFC switches  one switch for each electrical phase. The OFC  device had a mechanical linkage that turns the internal fuses approximately a  .25 turn. The turning of the fuse .25 turn disconnects the fuses from their  contact points within the switch. The fuses are immersed in clear dielectric  oil  which is intended to quench any electrical arc that may occur when the  fuses are connected or disconnected from an energized electrical source. The  three OFC switches are opened and closed simultaneously through the use of the  mechanical linkage. Electrical power was still energized to the incoming  (line) side of the fuse contact point within the OFC switches. Opening the OFC  switch device deenergized the electrical power to the OFC fuses and to a  malfunctioning transformer powered by the OFC switch device. As part of the  troubleshooting process Employee #1 checked the fuses in the OFC switches. One  fuse holder was removed completely and visually inspected. Employee #1 saw  that the fuse was blown and noted that the dielectric oil within the switch  was dark in color. Employee #1 placed the fuse holder on the floor and then  raised the other two fuse holders and supported them on the fuse holder's  alignment dowels that were located on the side of the fuse holder  partially  suspending the fuse holder in the OFC switch. Employee #1 then assisted  Employee #2 in inspecting the malfunctioning transformer unit. After assisting  Employee #2 in the inspection of the transformer  Employee #1 returned to  inspect the remaining two fuses in the OFC switches. To inspect the fuses  Employee #1 had partially removed the fuse holder slightly from their  suspended positions in the OFC switch. Employee #1 looked at the fuse to  determine if the fuse was blown. Employee #1 then lowered the fuse holder back  into the OFC switch suspending the fuse holders on the alignment dowel pins.  After completing the inspection of the fuses  Employee #1 slightly rotated one  of the fuse holders so that it would be better supported. Immediately after  Employee #1 pulled his hand from the fuse holder he heard a ""pop"" sound. At  that time an arc flash occurred within the OFC switch. This arc flash caused  intense radiant heat and a short lived fire which expanded out of the OFC  switch into the electrical room burning Employee #1 Employee #2 and the  coworker who led them into the room. Employee #1 and #2 were hospitalized and  suffered from unspecified burns as a result of the event.                       "
202467098, Employee Is Burned By Arc Flash , On July 28  2008  Employee #1 was an electrician. He was on a trouble call for  the nonworking scoreboard at the City of Lancaster Park. In the electric room   he found a dead leg on the main breaker. At the fuse box  he pulled the  disconnect handle down to the open position and opened the door in order to  replace the fuse. Employee #1 checked the voltage on all three phases and  determined that all three phases were dead. He then tested the continuity on  each fuse and determined that the fuse on phase B was bad. Employee #1 pulled  the bad fuse with his hand and gave it to a coworker. He placed a new fuse  against the clips and tested voltage on all three phases to ensure they were  still dead.

201186301, Foreman Is Burned When Fuel Ignites During Machine Refueling , At approximately 2:25 p.m. on June 25  2012  Employee #1  a Foreman for  Rainbow Waterproofing & Restoration Co.  was working at a 22-story building  site in San Francisco. The building was undergoing extensive exterior  restoration due to water damage  including removing the masonry facade and  cleaning the rusted steel beam using pneumatic hammers and needle guns. Two  gasoline powered air compressors (Rolair Systems with Honda engines  Model  #8422HK30) had been placed on the third floor roof of the building. Each  compressor had a 1.5-gallon gas tank and a 9-gallon air tank. In addition   each compressor had a 7.5-gallon auxiliary air tank. The compressors were  usually refueled twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.  Gasoline was kept in a 5-gallon type-I flammable liquid can equipped with a  plastic funnel. The employer had recently purchased a different brand of  flammable liquid can (Justrite) whose attached funnel was designed so that it  could be bent and take less space during storage/transportation. That feature  made the funnel susceptible to leakage when pouring the liquid. Employee #1  was refueling one of the compressors. The employer's procedure for refueling  the air compressors  as well as other gas powered equipment  was to ensure the  engine was off. According to the employer's subsequent statement  as Employee  #1 refueled the compressor  the gasoline leaked from the two sides of the  attached funnel onto the hot muffler of the compressor and ignited. Coworkers  #1 and #2  who were on the swing stage  suddenly lost air pressure on their  needle guns and saw that the compressors were on fire. They grabbed their fire  extinguisher and assisted Employee #1 to extinguish the fire. The fire was  extinguished by the time the Fire Department arrived. Employee #1 was  transported to a hospital  where he was treated for a first degree burn on his  right forearm  burns to the face  and smoke inhalation. He was then released.  The cause of the accident was spilling of gasoline onto the hot muffler.  Cal/OSHA regulation T8 CCR 5451(e) requires employers to take precautions  against liquid spillage and sources of ignition when transferring flammable  and combustible liquid from one container into another. Although T8 CCR  5451(p) also requires bonding and grounding of containers during such  transfer  static electricity probably was not a major contributing factor in  this fire incident.

After the new antennas were installed  a ""gin pole"" (a  48-foot long section) was being lowered to the ground in the center of the  tower. Employee #1 and another employee were riding on the ""gin pole"" (one at  the top and one at the bottom). While the ""gin pole"" was being lowered to the  ground  Employee #1  riding on the bottom  fell about 40 feet to the ground  and was killed.                                                                 "
200641751, Employee Killed In Fall From Communication Tower , Employee #1 along with his foreman was in the process of landing a piece of  tower structure to be added to the top of this communications tower  standing  approximately 200 to 300 feet above ground level. While the two men were in  the process of moving the section into position to be bolted into place  the  hoist operator set the dogs on the hoist to hold the load in place while he  dealt with a distraction that had just come up. Just after the hoist dogs had  been set  and as the hoist operator was dealing with the distraction  the  hoist line slipped. The hoist operator was close enough to the hoist to apply  the hoist brake  thereby catching the structure before it fell to the ground.  The sudden impact of the load on the hoist line caused the gin pole attachment  mounted on the side tower near the top of the structure to break lose from the  tower  while at the same time the tower section on the end of the hoist line  swung into the side of the tower  causing the tower to tremble. At this time   Employee #1 starts coming out of the tower  supposedly thinking the tower was  about to come down. While coming down out of the tower  Employee #1 falls off  the tower some 200 plus feet to the ground. The job foreman also comes off the  tower with no problem or injury. Both men were wearing the required fall  protection equipment and were experienced tower erectors. The hoist operator  was both the president of the company as well as the hoist operator  with  several years experience in both hoist operation as well as tower erection.  The hoist operator acknowledged that he had inspected  or at least looked over  the hoisting equipment prior to his using the equipment. The owner of the  hoist provided literature illustrating that the hoist had just been overhauled  immediately prior to being brought to and used on this job. The hoisting  equipment  including both the hoist and the gin pole  were already attached to  the tower when this company arrived on site to replace a previous erection  company who was removed from the job by the owner of the tower. The  distraction listed above was caused by the previous company arriving on the  job site only to see the Diamond C Company working on this tower. They were  using the hoisting equipment without their knowledge of the change made by the  tower owner and general contractor of the tower construction. It was concluded  that the accident was caused by the hoist operator using the hoist brake to  arrest the fall of the tower section  which caused the gin pole to break lose  from the tower and the structure on the end of the hoist line to swing into  the tower  sending strong vibrations throughout the tower  causing Employee #1  to think that the tower was about to come down. This tower was still standing  several days after the accident as well as at the time the CSHO returned to  the job site to finish the onsite investigation a day or so after the  accident.

The  injured Employee #1  an apprentice elevator mechanic was working with a  foreman and mechanic for the installation of a new hydraulic elevator into a 3  level office building. There were two personnel assigned to the crew for this  installation. At the time of the accident the foreman was at the bottom of the  hoist way about 19 feet below the landing where Employee #1 was working near  the hoist way opening on level 2. Prior to and at the time of the accident   the workers were in the process of lowering equipment  tools and materials  into the hoist way by use of a pulley which the foreman had installed at the  top of the hoist way and a capstan motor installed at the base of the shaft  with a hoist line and shackle. The materials to be lowered included six   sixteen-foot metal elevator rails. Employee #1 would attach the end of the  hoist line to the leading end of the rail through a hole in the rail end and  then manually lift the trailing end and walk it forward while straddling it as  the foreman ran the capstan motor until the trailing end cleared the landing  at the 2nd floor level  at which point the rail was then lowered down to the  bottom. Employee #1 experienced difficulty untying the first rail they lowered  because the shackle in the end of the 16 ft. rail was 3 ft. below the edge of  the hoist way 2nd level landing when it reached bottom  requiring him to reach  down into the hoist way to disconnect it. He next utilized some 1/2 inch nylon  rope to extend the hoist line length and lifted four more rails in this manner  which allowed him to disconnect without leaning into the hoist way  however he  was not wearing or using the available fall protection equipment during these  lifts. The nylon rope apparently loosened while lifting the final rail  but  this occurred before the trailing end had cleared the edge of the 2nd level  landing. Employee #1 was about 3 feet from the edge of the hoist way when the  leading end of the rail began to drop downward and the trailing end began to  shift back into the 2nd level landing. Eventually the trailing end being  carried by Employee #1 levered upward as the leading end fell into the hoist  way  catapulting him forward and into the hoist way. Employee #1 landed on the  concrete floor below  suffering multiple injuries including: broken vertebrae   broken left ankle  broken left tibia and fibula  and a broken pelvis. The  foreman for this crew failed to ensure that Employee #1 or himself were using  fall protection where exposed to potential falls into the elevator hoist way.  The Division concluded that this accident was preventable had the provisions  of T8 CCR 1670(a) been followed to ensure the use of fall protection and a  serious accident-related violation was issued.

The kettle  was a portable piece of equipment that is equipped with LPG fueled heaters.  Solid pieces of tar that were delivered to the jobsite are loaded into the  kettle and heated into a liquid tar. It took approximately three hours for the  solid tar to become liquid and during this process  the motor and pump on the  kettle operated in order to circulate the tar through the kettle. The  liquefied tar was pumped through a closed piping system to the roof area. When  the pump was not delivering hot tar to the roof area  the pump continues to  operate and a diverter was used to recirculate the hot tar through the kettle.  This recirculation was conducted in order to prevent the tar from settling on  the bottom of the kettle. The diverter valve was manually operated through an  accessible handle located on the valve and diverted the hot tar between  circulating through the kettle and up to the roof area  dependent on the needs  of the workers. As the kettle was in recirculation mode  without notifying  Employee #1  one of the coworkers walked over to the pipe that supplies tar to  the roof and pulled on a rope that was connected to the diverter valve. This  action should have allowed the hot tar in the kettle to be diverted to the  roof; however  the motor shut down.

200033017, Two Employees Suffocate In Manhole Accident , On June 20  2007  Employees #1 and #2 were working in an approximately 7 ft  diameter water vault located about 16 ft underground. The vault contained a 12  in. water main and a 4 in. water main that was equipped with a water meter.  The vault had been constructed approximately ten days earlier and had sat  undisturbed until the day of the accident  when the employees were schedulued  to conduct a pressure test of the system. Employee #1  the foreman  went down  into the vault to read the meter. When he did not return  Employee #2  a  laborer  looked down through the manhole cover and saw Employee #1 laying on  the ground. Employee #2 called out to a coworker that Employee #1 was down and  then entered the vault through the manhole and climb down the ladder. The  coworker came over to the manhole and saw Employee #1 on the ground and  Employee #2 hanging upside down  with his leg caught between the ladder rungs.  Neither employee responded to the coworker's calls and he started down the  manhole. The coworker also started down the manhole but noticed an  overpowering musty odor and abruptly stopped and exited. The Fire Department  and paramedics responded to the job site and retrieved Employees #1 and #2   both of whom had died. At the time of rescue the Fire Department's four gas  meters measured the oxygen level in the vault at approximately 9.2 ppm. In its  referral to OSHA  the Fire Department referenced two workers who succumbed to  an IDLH atmosphere.                                                             
14367346, Employee Asphyxiated By Carbon Monoxide And Dies , Employee #1  the owner and only employee of Inter Lining  was working alone  inside his shop fixing a urethane spray gun. He apparently started a  propane-powered 25 KV generator  and the fumes filled the area to IDLH levels.  The fire department reading for carbon monoxide was 700 to 900 ppm. Employee  #1 was wearing an air line pressure demand respirator which was operating  inside the building. It appears the air intake from the respirator's  compressor was picking up the exhaust from the generator and supplying it  directly to Employee #1. He died of carbon monoxide asphyxiation.               
170702674, Two Employees Overcome By Trichloroethane Vapors , Employee #1 was applying Polygard #650LTFR primer to the concrete walls of 5  ft by 5 ft planter boxes with varying depths of 8 ft  12 ft  and 16 ft. Two of  each size (6 in all) were to be primed. They were confined spaces. The primer  was pure 1 1 1 trichloroethane (TCE). Employee #1 was wearing a cartridge type  half face respirator  rather than the supplied air type required for TCE.  Employee #1 was overcome and became unconscious from the toxic TCE vapors.  Measurements indicated at least 80 000 ppm of TCE vapors at the bottom of the  16 ft planter box that Employee #1 had entered. The IDLH level is 1 000 ppm.  Employee #2  without a respirator  attempted to rescue Employee #1 but was  overcome and fell unconscious. The fire department rescued both Employees #1  and #2.

An employer representative for Vaquero Financial  Inc. reported this accident to the San Bernardino District Office at 3:00 p.m.  on April 8  2013.                                                               
202544490, Worker'S Thumb Is Amputated By Falling Particle Boards , At 8:30 a.m. on July 26  2012  Employee #1 was working for a general  contractor with over fifty years of experience in construction. The employer  was engaged in design  build  and construction management services. It  specialized in commercial  agricultural  industrial  and residential  construction. Employee #1 had joined the company on July 2  2012. He attended  once a week safety meetings conducted at the job site. He did not receive  specific safety training on the subject of assisting during the loading of  material. Employee #1 and a coworker had been assigned by a foreman to pick up  17 sheets of particle board in a storage yard. The coworker was operating a  JLG Model Number 10054 Skytrak aerial lift  with Serial Number 0160044376  to  pick up the particle board. First  the coworker used one fork to push the top  17 particle boards off the rest of the stack. Then he used one fork to lift  the corner of these particle boards. Employee #1 was asked to put a 2-inch by  4-inch by 20-inch (50-millimeter by 100-millimeter by 0.51-meter) piece of  scrap lumber underneath the top 17 sheets at the center of the particle  boards. This was being done so that forks could later go underneath the boards  and raise them. When Employee #1 stuck his hand under the boards to adjust the  scrap lumber  the 17 sheets of particle boards slammed down on his hand. The  load slipped and fell on Employee #1's hands  causing finger injuries. His  thumb was crushed and amputated  and his index and middle fingers were injured  as well. Factors contributing to the accident included failure to balance the  load and failure to brace and secure it to prevent it from tipping and falling  (Title 8 3650 (l). The incident was reported to the DOSH Los Angeles office by  the employer at 9:37 a.m. that same day.                                        
200758571, Employee Electrocuted By Contact With Overhead Conductor , On December 1  2007  Employee #1 and a coworker  of the New River Electrical  Corporation  were using a JLG aerial lift to install new electrical equipment.  At the time of the accident  they were removing the ground from a 345-kilovolt  electrical line. The coworker was holding the hot stick and  once the JLG  basket had been raised and positioned between two overhead conductors  he  began to remove the ground. Employee #1 was reaching over to assist him when  he contacted an overhead conductor and was electrocuted. The coworker holding  the hot stick felt a tingle  but he was not injured. The area the employees  were working in was very congested and too small for the lift they were using.  This caused them to violate the minimum approach distance. The line was  de-energized  however induced voltage was still present. A secondary ground  had not been installed to protect the employees from induced voltage. The  employees were not familiar with working with high voltage and were not clear  on the hazards of induced voltage. The workers in the JLG lift were fourth-  and fifth-step apprentices. The assigned foreman for the site  a seventh-step  apprentice  had left the site temporarily to obtain fuel and there was no  other supervision available to observe the job task.                            
201065729, Electric Shock , A journeyman power line worker was replacing insulators on a 230-kilovolt  overhead power line with the assistance an apprentice power line worker. The  journeyman was on a 3.7-meter-long Epoxiglas hook ladder (Hubbell-A. B. Chance  Catalog No. #H4904-12)  which was suspended from the truss of the top arm of  the tower supporting the power line. After completing the work  he removed the  grounding cables and gave them to the apprentice. As the journeyman was  descending the fiberglass ladder  he contacted the power line  which was  energized by induced current. The employee sustained an electric shock and  fell off the ladder  flipping upside down suspended from his harness. He  remained suspended this way for more than 30 minutes. The apprentice climbed  the tower and administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation to his injured  coworker. The supervisor relieved the apprentice  who apparently moved away  and also contacted energized parts. The apprentice sustained an electric shock  and burns. The journeyman was pronounced dead of electrocution just after  arriving at the hospital. The apprentice was hospitalized for treatment of his  burns and for observation.                                                      
202064168, Electric Shock , A power line contractor had a contract with an electric utility to install a  161-kilovolt overhead power line from a tower to a new switching substation.  The contractor was replacing an existing line of 954 MCM ACSR conductors from  the North tower to the substation with a new line of 2034 MCM ACSR conductors.  The new conductors had been connected at the North tower and were being  secured at an A-frame in the substation. The general supervisor had directed  the removal of all protective grounding jumpers from the North and South  towers. Two employees were in a personnel platform on a crane. A bonding  jumper was installed between the phase conductor and the platform on the  crane. The truck crane was not adequately grounded to earth. The phase  conductor was grounded through the hoist  but no other protective grounds were  installed. The two employees had just completed splicing the ends of the three  phase conductors from the North tower to their counterparts on the A-frame.  Each of the phase conductors was held by a 2.7-metric-ton hoist. The employees  had clipped in the first phase conductor. One of them then started to remove  the hoist from that conductor and received an electric shock. The employee let  go of the hoist  but grabbed it again and gave it a big push to force it away  from the conductor. When the hoist separated from the conductor  the employee  was electrocuted. The power line on which the employees were working was  deenergized; however  a 500-kilovolt overhead power line ran parallel to it. A  test on the lower voltage line after the accident found it to be energized at  7000 volts through induction from the higher voltage line.                      
955963, Electric Shock , Three employees were working from an aerial lift on a 21-meter-tall steel  electric transmission tower. The employees were unable to extend the aerial  lift bucket to the area where a grounding jumper was to be disconnected. To  access the jumper  one of the employees decided to climb onto the tower. He  transferred onto a crossmember on the deenergized side of the tower. His left  foot slipped from the crossmember. Although he was tied off to the structure   his left leg contacted a wind brace while his right forearm touched one of the  deenergized overhead power line conductors. This conductor was energized by  induced current  and the employee was electrocuted.                             
202317053, Electric Shock , A power line crew was replacing insulators on a 230-kilovolt overhead power  line. Five other circuits ran parallel to the power line on which the crew was  working. Two journeyman power line workers on the crew were working from an  uninsulated aerial lift. They completed work on the top phase conductor. One  of the two employees removed the grounding jumper from the steel arm of the  structure before he disconnected it from the phase conductor. He was  electrocuted by induced current in the phase conductor.                         
200711364, Electric Shock , A contractor was constructing a new overhead power line approximately 12.2  meters from an existing 345-kilovolt overhead power line. Two employees were  working at a height of 20.4 meters from a two-person platform mounted on a  Terex hydraulic crane. They were installing jumpers on the new power line. One  of the two employees  an apprentice power line worker  was electrocuted   apparently by induced voltage on the new line.                                  
201750486, Electric Shock , A power line worker working in a substation was replacing a jumper on a  deenergized conductor. Protective grounds had not been installed  and the  jumper was energized by induced current. The employee was electrocuted.         
200030963, Electric Shock , A journeyman power line worker and a first-step apprentice were working from  an uninsulated aerial lift  replacing bell insulators on a deenergized   three-phase  345-kilovolt overhead power line. Steel towers supported the  line. The crew had grounded the deenergized line  but had not set up an  equipotential zone at the tower at which they were working. The power line  worker was electrocuted when he contacted an end of an energized protective  ground. The apprentice also received an electric shock when the aerial lift  platform became energized. He was hospitalized for his injuries.                
101350643, Electric Shock , Two apprentice linemen were assigned the task of installing a grounded static  line on a deenergized 230-kilovolt overhead power line. The employees were  working from an insulated aerial lift. One of the employees had attached one  end of a grounding cable to a grounded phase conductor. He then moved the  aerial lift bucket to the other phase conductor. He had positioned the bucket  so that this conductor was between the two apprentices. The two employees were  so close to the conductor that the second apprentice had to bend backwards to  avoid contacting the conductor. The employees had not tested the conductor for  voltage. The first apprentice grabbed the conductor with his bare hand while  he was holding the grounding cable. The phase conductor was energized by  induced current  and the employee was electrocuted.                             
200780245, Electric Shock , A power line crew was upgrading an overhead power line. One of the power line  workers on the crew removed a protective ground that should not have been  removed. The employee received a fatal electric shock from induced current in  the power line.                                                                 
200961795, Electric Shock , Two power line workers were standing in a crane-suspended personnel platform  being hoisted by a truck crane. They were going to attach a grounding cable to  a static line for an overhead power line. After that  they were going to  install a block for pulling in a new fiber-optic cable. While the personnel  platform was being hoisted  high winds blew the platform toward the  deenergized power line. One of the employees reached out  touched the power  line  and received an electric shock. The platform continued toward the line   and the employee contacted it a second time. His coworker saw that the injured  employee was in trouble  so he signaled the crane operator to lower the  platform. The injured employee was not breathing  so his coworkers  administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation to no avail. The injured employee  was transported to a hospital  where he was pronounced dead. Although the  power line was deenergized  a nearby line had induced voltage on it. Neither  of the employees was using electrical protective equipment at the time of the  accident.                                                                       
201040334, Electric Shock , Two power line workers were working from a two-person aerial lift. They were  removing the static line above a deenergized  three-phase  230-kilovolt  overhead power line. The static line was located about 34 meters above the  ground. The deenergized line was on the east side of the supporting towers   and an energized three-phase  230-kilovolt overhead power line was on the west  side of the towers. The static line was apparently energized by induction from  the energized transmission line. The jumper on the bottom phase conductor had  been protected by a polyethylene cover; however  this cover had been  displaced  possibly because of movement of the platform or vibration. The boom  on the aerial lift contacted the exposed jumper  and one of the power line  workers was electrocuted.

This platform had neither guardrails nor Employee #1 was  wearing a fall protection. The tree branch was cut and  while falling  it hit  the platform of the lift  causing the lift to tilt. Employee #1 jumped from  the lift toward the tree. However  he missed the tree and fell to the ground.  He was killed.                                                                  
200211175, Employee Killed When Struck By Transport Truck , On October 14  2002  a highway construction crew was waiting for a transport  truck to deliver a load of lime pellets to the jobsite location so they could  spread them along a stretch of new construction. The transport truck driver  was given directions by the Project Superintendent on where he should back up.  The transport truck driver began his unloading run and when he got to the end   there were still lime pellets in the trailer to dump. The driver talked to the  Project Superintendent by radio and was told to back up and begin another  short unloading run. The driver began backing up when Employee #1  the  blademan  ran down the new construction roadway waving his arms and indicating  the driver to stop. The driver struck and killed Employee #1.                   
200462356, Employee Dies After Aerial Lift Tips Over , At approximately 10:21 a.m. on February 7  2009  Employee #1 was working for  Tremco  Inc.  a manufacturer  distributor and installer of waterproofing  materials. Workers from Tremco  Inc. were working with workers from Reliable  Roofing and Sheet Metal  LLC  inspecting the water damage to the roof of a  building. Reliable rented a Grove Aerial Lift  Model Number A125J. The  Reliable Roofing foreman moved the lift into position to place it into  operation. Two of the wheels were on the sidewalk  and two of the wheels were  in the street. The wheels on the street were on a stack of three 1.75-in.  thick boards. The Reliable foreman operated the lift from the basket  with  Employee #1 riding in the basket. The operator moved the boom to reposition it  to access a lower level of the roof. The operator had not been trained in the  proper procedures for operating this machine. He lowered the lower riser while  the other boom sections of the lift were still telescoped out. The sensors  that should have presented this maneuver did not function. Another limit  switch should have prevented the operator from lowering below a 72 degree  angle with the boom extended  but it also malfunctioned. The operator lowered  to an angle of 55 degrees  whereupon the machine exceeded its tipping moment.  As it fell  the machine's man basket struck the corner of a neighboring  building. Half of the basket was sheared off and the operator was thrown to  the second story rooftop. The rest of the basket and Employee #1 were thrown  into a fire door leading to the fire escape of the fourth floor of the  neighboring building. Both workers were transported to Massachusetts General  Hospital for treatment. Employee #1 died. The operator of the lift had never  received specific formal training for the lift that he had been operating that  day  and did not know its operational limitations. He did not perform any  preoperation checks or inspections which would have identified the  malfunctioning switches.                                                        
201350667, One Employee Killed  Second Injured When Mast Platform Fell , Employee #1 was killed and Employee #2 was seriously injured and hospitalized  when they were on an HEK MSM 1000 mast climbing work platform which fell  approximately 60 feet to the ground. The employer failed to ensure that the  limit switch actuating rail  also known as the red painted top mast  was  installed on the supporting mast before the platform was used. The red painted  top mast actuates the limit switch of the motor  which prevents the platform  from traveling upwards. Because this portion of the mast was missing  the  platform was not prevented from being lifted beyond its supporting mast  and  falling to the ground.                                                          
200452720, Employee Dies In Excavation Collapse , On September 23  2010  Employee #1 and a coworker were working in a trench for  laying a new section of sewer line that to be connected to an existing sewer  line. Each section of piping consisted of 10 inches-diameter plastic pipe that  measured 14 feet in length. The excavated area had a slight downhill angle and  had an underground water stream/buildup at a depth of about 9 to 12 fee  which  sometimes caused approximately 1 to 2 inches of water to accumulate on the  bottom of the trench. As Employee #1 and the coworker were located in a twelve  foot deep section of the excavation  awaiting the next section of pipe to be  lowered for installation  a large portion of the excavation wall gave way.  Dirt filled the excavation  covering Employee #1 and the coworker up to their  shoulders. Both Employee #1 and the coworker were taken to a nearby medical  facility for treatment. Employee #1 died  while the coworker was treated for  multiple broken ribs and damaged lungs. The injury line only reported one  employee.                                                                       
201363140, Employee Killed When High Pressure Hose Fitting Fails , On December 28  2007  Employee #1 was participating in the pressure testing of  a 26-mile-long pipeline. The company was using a 2 in. diameter high pressure  hose fitted with RYCO T400 series fittings. The hose separated from the  fitting connecting it to the pipeline when the pressure reached approximately  1 725 psi. Employee #1 was struck in the head either by the flying hose or by  the high-pressure jet of water. He fell  striking his head on a steel pipe as  he landed. Employee #1 was killed. No safety devices were in place to restrain  the hose in the event of failure.

A reducer/adapter pipe fitting was overpressurized during the course of the  test and the pipe fitting separated. It flew out at high velocity and struck  Employee #1 in the head. He was transported to the hospital  where he died on  April 17  2003. The Aquachlor employee was not a part of the hydrostatic test  and was only there to chlorinate the water line. Subsequent investigation  revealed that on December 12  2002  a hydrostatic test was being performed  using the same type of fitting and it also separated when the line was  pressurized for the test. There were no injuries reported for that incident.    
200711059, Employee Killed When Struck By Flying Valve And Pipe , Employee #1 was working in a 7.8 ft deep trench when he was struck and killed  by a 46-in.-long  500-lb butterfly valve and pipe connection. Several factors  may have caused the   the water valve could have been turned on at a  nearby structure; the air release valves could have been closed; the  mechanical joints holding the valve onto the pipe may have been loosened by  the backhoe; or the water inside the pipe may have had enough force to blow  off the valve. The trench was sloped on only one side.                          
200672368, Employee Killed When Struck By Flying Pipe Section , Employee #1 had been contracted by City of West Palm Beach  FL  to install the  plumbing for a memorial to honor a civil rights leader. He was standing on a  pile of dirt about 3 ft high  observing the pressure testing of a section of  3-in.-diameter pipe in the plumbing system. Employee #1 had glued this section  together about 18 hours earlier. One hundred pounds of water pressure was  applied for approximately 15 minutes when a joint failed  causing a section of  the pipe to fly off and strike him in the head and face. Employee #1 was  killed.                                                                         
170872667, Employee Burned When Hot Tar Sprays From Delivery Pipe , Employee #1  an experienced Class 5 roofer apprentice  was part of a crew  preparing a roof for tar application. He was working on the tar kettle and  went down  without permission  to check its temperature and before the crew  was ready for it. After checking the temperature and tar level  Employee #1  started the pump. He failed  however  to check the connection of the tar  delivery pipe above his head. Hot tar sprayed out of the pipe and onto  Employee #1's face  neck  shoulder  back  and hands. He sustained  second-degree burns to his upper body  for which he was hospitalized.           
200783249, Employee Electrocuted During Work On Electrical Cabinet ," On July 24  2004  Employee #1 attached a new elbow to the end of a new  high-voltage leg of a three-phase conductor. He was plugging it into a  receptacle in the cabinet when he was electrocuted. The receptacle was  supposed to be de-energized  while all the other conductors in the cabinet  were live. Employee #1 did not use the available ""hot"" stick to plug the elbow  into the receptacle as a precaution in case it was energized.                   "
200780880, Electric Shock , A power line crew foreman was observing a power line worker using a live-line  tool to reinstall a fuse door in an aboveground transformer. The power line  worker was having difficulty cocking the fuse. The foreman instructed the  employee to remove the live-line tool. The foreman walked 1 meter over to the  7200-volt fuse  grabbed it  and was electrocuted.                               
201350485, Electric Shock & Burn , Two power line workers were working from an insulated aerial lift  installing  armor rods on a 240-kilovolt overhead power line. One of the employees  a  supervisor  was using a live-line tool to install the armor rods. The tool  contacted the concrete pole and the ground wire hanging from the top of the  pole  and current arced from the power line. (The ground wire was connected to  the static wire on top of the pole.) The employee holding the live-line tool  was electrocuted. His coworker received an electric shock and sustained  second- and third-degree burns when the aerial lift burst into flames. He was  hospitalized for his injuries.                                                  
170577688, Electric Shock , A contractor for an electric utility was installing a new phase conductor to  an existing overhead power line. A power line worker for the contractor was  working from the bucket of a Reach All aerial lift (Model No. AP52MH; Serial  No. 7814)  which was rated for 69 kilovolts. The employee  who had about 8  years of experience as a power line worker  was equipped with a hard hat  a  jumper cable  rubber insulating gloves  and a live-line tool (shot gun stick).  The superintendent for the operation was switching the line from a location  about 3.2 kilometers (2 miles) away. The superintendent and his crew were  reducing the load on the line  so that the power line worker could safely  apply a jumper to the conductor he was installing. The ground worker working  with the power line worker was in communication with the superintendent's  crew. The ground worker told the power line worker that the load had been  dropped  and the power line worker started attaching the jumper cable. The  ground worker looked up to find the power line worker slumped over the bucket.  The ground worker  who did not feel qualified to operate the lower level  controls on the aerial lift  requested help by radio. The injured employee was  transported to a hospital  where he was pronounced dead of electrocution. He  had entry and exit wounds on his right hand  by the fingers  and on his left  foot. The boot had been torn off this foot by the electric current. The power  line worker had not been wearing his rubber insulating gloves. (The  superintendent stated that he had told everyone to wear them.) Apparently  the  power line worker's right hand contacted the power line at some point in the  operation. The live-line tool was still connected to one of the jumper clamps;  this clamp was fastened to the new phase conductor.                             
882647, Electric Shock , A power line worker climbed up the east side of a steel transmission tower to  hang a hand line  which was to be used to hoist equipment. Apparently  his  right hand came too close to the 100-kilovolt overhead power line  and the  employee was electrocuted.                                                      
200998524, Employee Is Killed When Caught Between Aerial Lift And Beam , On January 25  2011  Employee #1 was operating a JLG Aerial Lift  and he came  in contact with a steel I-beam.

201185527, Employee Is Injured When Pinned Between Lift And Ceiling ," On September 20  2010  Employee #1  who was employed by an electrical  contractor  was working as an electrician's helper at a jobsite in San  Francisco. Employee #1's employer  who was away from the site  was  subcontracted to install overhead lighting fixtures and perform other  electrical work in a new building. Employee #1 was operating a Snorkel Model  Number S1930 scissor lift to pull and staple wiring on the ceiling of the  hallway on the ground floor. The wires were to be later attached to an  overhead lighting fixture. Employee #1 was in the scissor lift  at a height of  approximately 15 feet and in the vicinity of a junction box located near the  ceiling. He had to lean over past the railing to reach the junction box that  was approximately two feet away. The platform of the scissor lift suddenly  elevated  and Employee #1 was pinned between its top rail and a wooden floor  joist. Another worker saw that Employee #1 was in trouble and came to his aid.  The general contractor operated another scissor lift to reach Employee #1 and  then brought him to the ground. Emergency services were called  and the San  Francisco Fire Department responded. Employee #1 was taken to San Francisco  General Hospital by ambulance. He was hospitalized and treated for fractured  ribs  a punctured lung  lacerations to his liver and pancreas  and a bruised  prostate. Employee #1's spleen was removed. The San Francisco Fire Department  but not the employer reported the incident to Cal/OSHA. The general  contractor  Employee #1  the employer  a coworker  and another employee were  interviewed during the course of the investigation. The employer was cited for  failure to train  which is a general violation. A Cal/OSHA regulation required  employees to be instructed in the safe use of the work platform  and Employee  #1 was not instructed before operating the scissor lift for the first time.  The violation was classified as ""general"" because the Division could not  establish substantial probability. The employer was also cited for not  notifying the Division about the incident. Other violations were observed  and  the employer was cited accordingly. The Division ordered the scissor lift to  be preserved on the day of the inspection. A forensics company was contracted  by Employee #1's attorney to evaluate the lift. During the examination  the  scissor lift had not demonstrated any unintended movement. Therefore  the  cause of the platform's sudden elevation  per Employee #1's account  was  undetermined.                                                                   "

Employee #1 also rigged up the load line using an open  hook and a simple block and tackle. After finishing these two tasks  Employee  #1 began to rappel down the load line with a Fisk Descender attached to the  front D-ring of his full-body harness. As he descended  the open hook rolled  out of the large carabineer attached to the top of the platform. Employee #1  fell approximately 150 feet to his death. The open hook  block and tackle  and  rope landed right beside him. The large carabineer was still hooked to the top  of the tower. The open hook was missing the safety latch. The block and tackle  was rated at 1 250 pounds and was intended for lifting equipment  not for life  safety purposes. Employee #1 was not using an independent lifeline when he  descended via the load line. Employee #1 had not been properly trained in fall  protection issues.                                                              
200232064, Electric Shock , An employer was using an area under a 7.2-kilovolt overhead power line for  storage and staging of material. Employees set up a crane under the power line  to move some of the stored material. As the crane hoisted a load of material  and swung it to the side  the crane boom or load line contacted the power  line  electrocuting a laborer who was performing rigging and signaling for the  crane.

As part of a  construction project to widen the 60 Freeway  Employee #1 was operating a  Lorain LRT-300 crane  a 30-ton capacity  rough terrain  hydraulic boom crane   to move heavy materials around the construction site. Employee #1 was  operating the crane with its front facing east and both axles perpendicular to  the 60 Freeway. The outriggers on the left side front and rear of the crane  were extended and deployed down. The outriggers on the right side front and  rear were not extended but deployed down. Employee #1 picked up a K-rail  weighing 7 800 pounds and swung it clockwise  in an attempt to place it at a  location northwest of the crane's position. The crane became unstable and  tipped over on its side  when the load/boom was positioned southeast  the same  side and position in which the two outriggers were not extended. Employee #1  was injured while jumping out of the tipping crane's cab. He was transported  to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina  California  where he was  hospitalized six nights for treatment of his injuries. Employee #1's injuries  included several fractured ribs  a fractured spinal column  contusions  and  lacerations to his elbow and head. No other workers were injured during the  incident. The Los Angeles County Fire Department reported the incident. The  investigators determined that Employee #1 did not derate the crane to ""on  rubber tires"" conditions  as required by the on board load chart whenever any  outrigger was not fully extended. Employee #1 was familiar with the crane's  lifting capacity ratings for extended outriggers  but did not know the lifting  capacity for ""on rubber tires"" conditions. The crane's ""on rubber tires"" rated  lifting capacity for a load at a radius of 39 feet was between 2 100 pounds  and 2 500 pounds  depending on the type of tires used. Therefore  the crane  tipped over because Employee #1 overloaded it. There was no evidence that the  crane's structural parts failed.                                                "

They were using a Lima 80T crawler tractor crane  #3284   700 HC to drive 30 ft long  10 in. by 1/2 in. I-beams into an excavation that  was 53 in. deep by 15 ft wide by 31 ft long. Rainwater in the pit was causing  the leads to set incorrectly. The water was forcing the leads and plate to  walk (move) toward the back (north) side of the excavation. The chain/binder  was removed from the leads and the pile drivers prior to moving (walking) the  crane rig in (northward) to set up the pile hammer and boom correctly for  continued vertical driving. The pile drivers and the foreman were to hold the  leads steady. At that time  apparently  the hammer came down on the pile and  struck it at an angle. This caused the lower leads to swing and twist out and  around and strike Employee #1 in the upper front leg area. He sustained  crushing injuries to his lower extremities and died.                            
14352363, Employee Killed In Fall From Fixed Ladder , Employee #1 was a member of a pile driving crew. The crew had placed a hollow  steel pile into the lead. The initial blow of the continuous ram diesel  pile-driving hammer drove the pile 2 to 3 feet into the ground. This caused  the wire rope cable (whip-line) to peel rapidly off the crane drum and wrap  around the outside of the drum. The whip-line  also referred to as the power  line  is choked around the piling and is used to hoist the pile into the lead  and to steady the pile while it is being driven. As the crew tried to free the  cable  they continued to hammer the piling  assuming that the whip-line cable  would unravel if the piling were forced lower into the ground. Instead  this  action placed tension on the crane boom  pulling it down toward the lead. When  the job foreman realized this  he attempted unsuccessfully to hammer at the  whip-line and knock it up the piling. When all methods failed to unravel the  line  the foreman instructed Employee #1 to climb on top of a shed adjacent to  the lead and to cut/burn the shackle on the whip-line. Employee #1 climbed the  lead ladder  was handed the cutting torch  and began to cut/burn the whip-line  itself  which was not what he had been instructed to do. As the whip-line was  severed  the crane boom  which was under tension toward the lead (ground)   suddenly sprang upward with great force and lifted the lead approximately 1  1/2 to 2 feet off the ground. This threw Employee #1 off the lead ladder  into  the side of the adjacent shed  and onto the ground. He was killed instantly.  The job superintendent stated that it was unusual for the pile to have been  driven so far into the ground because other piles had sunk no more than 12 to  18 inches on the initial blow.

As he was installing a 120-volt  15-ampere  receptacle outlet in the bathroom of the apartment  he contacted energized  parts and was electrocuted. The general contractor reported that  on the  morning of the accident  the electrician had complained of receiving electric  shock and was told to deenergize the circuit and remove the circuit breaker.  His employer's policy was to deenergize and locked out electric equipment  before beginning work.                                                          
201110152, Burn , A painter and two helpers employed by a painting contractor were working at a  hair salon. They were removing old paint from several sections of wood  paneling inside the shop. The three employees were using a chemical paint  stripper to remove the paint. The paint stripper was flammable. The painter  applied the paint stripper to the walls with a paint roller  and the two  helpers scraped the residue off the paneling. Energized receptacle outlets  were located on the walls. The employees had removed the cover plates from the  receptacles and used masking tape to seal off the openings for the plugs;  however  they left the sides and backs of the receptacles exposed. While they  were working  they brought in some fans for ventilation. Shortly after the  fans were turned on  the paint stripper vapors and residue ignited  starting a  fire. The painter suffered second- and third-degree burns for which he was  hospitalized. He subsequently required surgery to treat his burns. The other  two employees were not injured.                                                 
202508362, Employee Fractures Leg And Arm In Fall At Oil Refinery ," At about 3:30 a.m. on January 28th  2011  an employee was working with two  coworkers inside the carbon monoxide flue duct removing refractory. This  accident site was an oil refinery that processes crude oil into saleable  petroleum products. The turnaround work involved in the accident consisted of  refractory removal inside a flue duct that was associated with the FCCU. The  work crew was moved to a new confined space area in the Duct works because the  refractory needed to be immediately removed at the location. The employer  required the workers removing refractory to work within four feet of the  leading edge associated with the 28 foot vertical fall hazard. Because of the  heavy weight of the rivet buster  the work crew traded off using the tool  until one got tired. The employee had finished using the rivet buster  and he  handed the tool to a coworker. For an unknown reason  he walked the wrong  direction into vertical flue duct section. The employee fell 28 feet onto a  staging area. The employee's supervisor did not work in the permit confined  with the workers. The employee and three coworkers were in a confined space  adjacent to the fall hazard. All the employees  including the supervisor   required for all the permitted flue duct spaces to be ""100 percent tie off"".  Nobody was tied-off  because no anchor points were established in the duct.  The following factors contributed to the   1) lack of barrier  restricting the movement by the fall hazard at the duct  and 2) lack of fall  protection for workers inside the duct as required by the confined space  permit. The employee sustained a broken femur and compound fracture of his  left arm.                                                                       "

201345287, Employee Sustains Burns In Flash Fire  Later Dies ," At approximately 2:50 p.m. on March 3  2010  Employee #1  a plumber  was  working with a coworker installing new furnaces and AC units at an apartment  complex. The furnace and AC units were all the same design and configuration.  They were flushing the existing .375 in. diameter copper lines of R22  refrigerant oil residue in preparation for the new 410 refrigerant. The  coworker was outside injecting the flammable liquid solvent into the line  and  Employee #1 was inside the apartment reclaiming the cleaning solvent mixture  utilizing a plastic coffee container. During this process  the vapors from the  solvent ignited (flash fire)  and the employee sustained second and third  degrees burns to 80% of his body. Employee #1 died several hours later at a  local Hospital. It was believed that the flash fire was a resulted from static  as the liquid was discharging out of the copper line into the plastic coffee  can. Cleaning the lines involved one person injecting a combination of  ""Virginia 10"" solvent and nitrogen into the existing copper lines using a  ""Pro-Flush"" injection system from the exterior of the structure and a second  person on the inside to reclaim the product at the end of the lines. The  ""Pro-Flush injection cylinder contained approximately 24 oz of the ""Virginia  10 (Class IB flammable liquid) degreasing solvent and an unknown quantity of  nitrogen. The ""Pro-Flush"" injection system was purchased from a vendor who was  selling products to plumbing companies for use in complying with the new EPA  rules for R410 refrigerant. The ""Pro-Flush"" device was originally purchased by  the company and included a can of nonflammable solvent. The employer decided  not to use the solvent originally purchased with the system and began to use  the Virginia 10  recommended by another company selling the products for  plumbers to be used for cleaning refrigerant lines being converted to R410  refrigerant.

He climbed the extension ladder and then  he climbed the rest of the way to the roof using a fixed ladder. The distance  from the rungs of the fixed ladder to the wall was less than 7 in. A roof  gutter near the top rung provided an obstruction which reduced this distance  much more. When Employee #1 reached to grab the top rung of the fixed ladder   the gutter apparently obstructed his grip on the rung. He lost his grip and  fell approximately 12 ft to the ground. He was hospitalized for treatment of  injuries that were not specified. He died 10 days later.

170174940, Employee Injured When Pneumatic Hand Tool Explodes , On September 11  1990  Employee #1  an ironworker for Wickman Steel Company   was using a portable Emglo compressor pneumatic hand tool  model KU  serial  #A315799. He was chalking and securing seismic floor bolts at the northeast  corner of the second floor of a four-story building under construction.  Employee #1 had filled 4 or 5 bolt holes when the rear air chamber suddenly  blew off the end of the tool  striking him on the right side of his chest  his  clavicle  neck  and face. The pneumatic hand tool  which was rated to a  maximum air pressure of 80 psi  was new to the job site and the employees were  unfamiliar with its operation. Prior to the accident  the foreman attempted to  set the air pressure on the new tool to the 80 psi maximum  but the compressor  did not have an air regulator valve. He attempted to regulate the pressure by  adjusting a motor control valve and a tank pressure gauge. The foreman stated  that when he checked the compressor after the accident  the pressure gauge was  reading 160 psi. He released the air  but the gauge still read 120 to 140 psi.  When a coworker tapped the gauge it went to zero. The pneumatic hand tool was  getting direct tank pressure. The foreman's attempt to set it to 80 psi  without a regulator valve connection  and a possibly faulty pressure gauge on  the motor control valve  were the main causal factors in this accident.         
14554893, Three Employees Suffer Exposure To Anhydrous Ammonia , On August 29  1990  four WS Bunch employees  engaged in paint contract work at  an Arcadian fertilizer manufacturing plant  were returning from lunch and  climbed to the fourth level of a structure used in the manufacturing of urea  in order to perform sandblasting operations. The employees were beginning to  put on their ppe when a nearby ammonia tank relief valve released twice   releasing anhydrous ammonia into the air. It surrounded Employees #1 through  #3. Their coworker had descended one level to retrieve a glove. The exposed  employees  who were not wearing their goggles or cartridge respirators   evacuated the tower  showered  and flushed their eyes. Oxygen was administered  and they were transported to the nearest hospital by a rescue squad. Employees  #1 and #2 were treated for chemical burns of the eyes  nasal passages  and  other body parts and were released. Employee #3 was treated for similar burns  and was held overnight. The employees who attempted to don their cartridge  respirators during the ammonia exposure indicated that the respirators were  ineffective in filtering out the ammonia.                                       
569574, Employee Dies After Being Crushed Between Two Press Rolls , Employee #1 was re-aligning two sets of press rolls.

He was operating the 36 meter boom with a wireless remote when it  contacted energized 12 000-volt overhead power lines. Apparently the  electricity traveled through the boom  the truck  and the wire-mesh-reinforced  water hose into Employee #1  who was standing on wet ground. A few minutes  later  the hydraulic tanks and lines on the truck failed  resulting in a large  fire that engulfed Employee #1. He was pronounced dead at the scene. There  were no witnesses to the actual accident or operation of the boom  although a  DOT employee saw the incident a few seconds after the initial contact with the  lines. Employee #1 was fully trained and experienced in the operation of the  truck. He had put the truck in the only place he could  given the work he had  to do  and had set up the pumping operation himself. Because of the truck's  location and the reach of the boom  the truck and its parts were capable of  coming in contact with live electric lines. Apparently  the accident was  partly caused by Employee #1's misjudgment of the position of the boom and its  ability to come into contact with the wires.

762609, Electric Shock , AN EMPLOYEE WAS MAKING FINAL ADJUSTMENTS TO A RESIDENTIAL WIRING SYSTEM. TWO  SECTIONS OF 12/2 AWG NON-METALLIC-SHEATHED CABLE (ROMEX) WERE USED TO SUPPLY  POWER FROM THE TEMPORARY ELECTRICAL SERVICE TO THE METER BASE FOR THE  RESIDENCE. THIS ALLOWED THE WIRING INSIDE THE HOUSE TO BE INSPECTED AND  EQUIPMENT TO BE CHECKED TO ENSURE THAT IT WORKED PROPERLY. THE EMPLOYEE WAS  UNDER THE HOUSE CONNECTING THE GROUNDING ELECTRODE CONDUCTOR TO THE COLD WATER  PIPE SERVING AS THE GROUNDING ELECTRODE. THE POLARITY OF THE TEMPORARY SERVICE  WAS REVERSED  AND THE GROUNDING ELECTRODE CONDUCTOR WAS ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO  AN UNGROUNDED CIRCUIT CONDUCTOR.

14400261, Electric Shock , A 24-year-old employee was standing on a metal ladder that was next to a  building. The ladder was resting on a 30.5-meter-long (100-foot-long)  extension cord set supplying electric power to a Makita electric drill. Due to  reversed polarity  the neutral conductor in the cord was energized at 120  volts. The sharp edge of the metal ladder penetrated the insulation on the  extension cord and contacted the neutral conductor. This  in turn  energized  the ladder. The employee was electrocuted when his hand touched the structural  metal frame of the building.

THE EMPLOYEE  WAS STANDING IN A DOORWAY  WITH HIS LEFT FOOT ON A CONCRETE SURFACE AND HIS  RIGHT FOOT ON A METAL-GRATE STAIRWAY LANDING. THE EMPLOYEE WAS LEFT HANDED. IT  IS BELIEVED THAT HE HELD THE ELECTRIC DRILL IN HIS LEFT HAND AND HELD THE  METAL STAIR RAILING (TO THE RIGHT OF THE DOOR) WITH HIS RIGHT HAND. THE  ELECTRIC DRILL HAD A 3-CONDUCTOR  6-FOOT FLEXIBLE CORD BETWEEN THE  GROUNDING-TYPE ATTACHMENT PLUG AND THE DRILL. THE DRILL WAS CONNECTED TO A  3-CONDUCTOR TEMPORARY LIGHTING CIRCUIT  WHICH IN TURN WAS ENERGIZED BY A  STANDARD 3-CONDUCTOR  ROUND  EXTENSION CORD SET. THIS CORD SET WAS PLUGGED  INTO A PERMANENT  120-VOLT  20-AMPERE RECEPTACLE. THE MOLDED ATTACHMENT PLUG  ON THE EXTENSION CORD SET HAD ITS GROUNDING PRONG REMOVED. IN DARKNESS  THE  CARPENTER INSERTED THE ATTACHMENT PLUG INTO THE PERMANENT RECEPTACLE IN A  REVERSE POLARITY POSITION. THIS CAUSED THE UNGROUNDED CIRCUIT CONDUCTOR TO BE  CONNECTED TO THE GROUNDED POLE OF A STANDARD SINGLE-PHASE  THREE-WIRE CIRCUIT.  A GROUND FAULT PERMITTED THE ELECTRIC DRILL CASE TO BECOME PART OF THE CIRCUIT  THROUGH THE IDENTIFIED GROUNDED CONDUCTOR (WHICH WAS CONNECTED TO THE  UNGROUNDED CONDUCTOR AT THE POINT OF REVERSE POLARITY). THERE WAS NO EQUIPMENT  GROUNDING CONDUCTOR TO PROVIDE A PATH TO GROUND. WHEN THE EMPLOYEE  WHO WAS  HOLDING THE DRILL  GRABBED THE METAL STAIR RAILING  HIS BODY COMPLETED THE  ELECTRIC CIRCUIT TO GROUND. THE EMPLOYEE COLLAPSED; THE ENERGIZED DRILL LANDED  ON HIS CHEST; AND HE WAS ELECTROCUTED.

14457428, Employee Injured In Fall From Roof , Employees were installing a standing-seam roof. Employee #1 was operating a  roof seamer and starting platform. He had been instructed in this operation  and had performed this work 2 weeks earlier. After sealing approximately 190  degrees of the roof  he set the equipment in place. Before the operation  started  the platform had to be clamped in place. However  an electric cord  became tangled in the seamer  and Employee #1 had to pick up seamer to remove  the cord and set the seamer in place again. After moving the unit  the  employee either did not install clamp or installed the clamp improperly. The  clamp failed  and the weight of seamer caused the rear of the starting  platform to rise into the air. The platform struck the employee  knocking him  several feet and causing him to fall 24 feet to ground level. He was  hospitalized for injuries sustained in the fall.                                
202532065, Roofer Falls From Ladder And Fractures Ankle , At 2:00 p.m. on June 19  2013  Employee #1  of Platinum Roofing Inc.  was  working as part of a roofing crew at a 17-story hotel. That morning  the crew  had applied the first coat of waterproofing material to the roof of an  elevator penthouse that rose 25 feet from the hotel roof. Employee #1 was  climbing a fixed ladder to check whether that first coat was dry and ready for  a second coat. When he was approximately 5 to 6 feet up the ladder  he slipped  and fell. He hit a small can of paint at the bottom of the ladder and then  landed on the roof floor. There were no witnesses to his fall. Employee #1's  crewmates immediately transported him to Torrance Memorial Hospital. He was  kept overnight at the hospital for observation of his swollen left ankle.  Employee #1 denied treatment at Torrance Memorial Hospital and requested  transfer to the hospital in his hometown. He was released from Torrance  Memorial Hospital on June 20  2013.

He was working alone in the back yard of a private residence  when the incident occurred. He was using two ladders to gain access to the  HVAC unit. To get from the ground to a patio roof level  Employee #1 was using  a 24-foot (7.3-meter) Werner Model Number D6224-2 fiberglass extension ladder.  This was an extra heavy duty type IA ladder. The ladder Employee #1 fell from  was a 13-foot (4.0-meter) Warner Model Number MT-13 aluminum multipurpose  ladder  with Part Number 65224-10. This too was an extra heavy duty type IA  ladder  and it was being used as a straight ladder at the time of the  incident. The aluminum ladder was placed on the roof of the patio to provide  access to the second-story roof. The patio's roof was made of tiles  and it  was unstable and not level. Employee #1 was ascending the aluminum ladder. He  had climbed to about the fourth or fifth rung of the ladder and was about eye  level with the eave of the second floor. At that point  tile beneath the  ladder broke  and Employee #1 fell along with the ladder. He fell  approximately 15 feet (4.6 meters). He sustained a fractured left wrist and  two fractured vertebrae. The accident was reported by the employer to the  Bakersfield District office at 7:54 a.m. the following day.

He was descending an aluminum  ladder to move it closer to the work site  in accordance with his immediate  supervisor's request. As he was about halfway down the ladder  he lost his  footing and fell about 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters). He landed on the  ground on his right side and sustained a fracture in his arm. He was  transported to the University of California Irvine (UCI) Health Center  in  Orange  CA  where he was treated and hospitalized for his injuries. The  employee's immediate supervisor was at the site  but he did not witness the  incident. There were no other witnesses. The immediate supervisor was  interviewed  but Employee #1 was not available for an interview. The employer  reported the incident to the Division at 5:00 p.m. on June 21  2013. The  Division initiated the investigation at 9:47 a.m. on August 12  2013.           
200171189, Worker Is Killed In Fall From Roof , At approximately 8:10 a.m. on May 15  2013  Employee #1 and Coworker #1   roofers employed by Independent Roofers and General Contractors Corp.  were  working at Building Number 46 of the Residential Nemesio R. Canales of Hato  Rey  a multi-family residential development. They were performing  waterproofing on the roof of the building. Employee #1 was walking backwards  and approaching the roof edge while applying roof sealer with a roller. He  fell off the roof and to the ground  a distance of 19 feet 2 inches. He  sustained an unspecified fracture and was killed. The subsequent investigation  determined that Employee #1 was not using a personal fall protection system   and no other type of fall protection had been installed on the roof.            
201129814, Worker Sustains Arm Fracture  Concussion In Fall From Roof , At approximately 3:30 p.m. on May 15  2013  Employee #1  a roofer employed by  Cal-Pac Roofing  was engaged in roofing activity at an existing single-story  residential house in South San Francisco  CA. He was working with his helper   Coworker #1. They were installing membrane vapor barrier on the roof. Employee  #1 fell off the roof and landed on a concrete floor approximately 8 feet  below. The homeowner came out of the house and placed a call for emergency  assistance. Employee #1 was transported to San Francisco General Hospital.  After two days of observation at the hospital  he was admitted. Employee #1  was treated for a fractured arm and a concussion. The employer reported this  event at approximately 4:12 p.m. on May 17  2013  within the required time  frame  to Cal/OSHA's San Mateo District Office. The subsequent investigation  began on May 23  2013. It included interviews and review of documents.  However  despite multiple attempts to interview Employee #1  he did not  cooperate. Coworker #1 also was unavailable for interview. The employer stated  that Coworker #2  a foreman/supervisor who was out of state at the time of the  fall  responded and went to the jobsite. Coworker #2 was interviewed during  the investigation. Coworker #2 stated that he interviewed Coworker #1 after  Employee #1's fall. He stated that Coworker #1 told him that both Employee #1  and Coworker #2 were installing membrane on the roof and were far away from  the roof's edge when Coworker #2 suddenly realized that Employee #1 had  vanished off the roof. Coworker #2 said he did not know the cause of the fall.  The investigation further determined that the pitch of the roof was  approximately 4:12  the roof was approximately 8 feet high  and the work  activity was not a new construction. Under T8 CCR 1730  roofers are exempt  from having fall protection if working at a height of less than 20 feet with  some conditions. At the time of the investigation report  due to lack of  Employee #1's cooperation  Cal/OSHA was unable to conclude whether the  conditions of T8 1730 were violated by the Employer. Therefore  there was no  plan to issue a citation.

This Rough Terrain Forklift had  been owned by PAR Electrical Contractors since 2007 or 2008. It was purchased  from a rental company  no operating manual was available at the time of the  incident. The tires were Firestone 14.00-24TH Super Ground 12-Ply rating  tubeless  (Made in USA VE0000 Cat TL1055 Number 30628 NY4J79). The fork  attachment was a Model Number 1001090014  Serial Number 2007176-03  with a  maximum capacity of 12 000/5 443  a maximum weight of 1 217 pounds  manufactured by JLG Industries. The fork distance above ground 12-ft with  45-degree boom angle  distance between the ground and bottom of rebar cage was  approximately 4-ft. 3-in. Employee #1 drove the Rough Terrain Forklift up  hill  on an approximate 10.5 feet wide dirt road. A crew was transporting an  approximate 11 800 pound 45-ft. by 5 ft. rebar cage in the back of a flatbed  truck. The rear load portion of the cage extended beyond the length of the  flatbed truck and was rigged with a four-way steel chain and shackle that was  suspended by the forklift's vertical mast. The boom angle was approximately 45  degrees extended at the B section of the boom indicator. The forks were  approximately 12 ft. above the ground. The dirt road contained a slope grade  of approximately 3.5 feet drop within a 15 ft. section. While the forklift  traveled forward on the steep slope at the rear of the flatbed truck  it began  to tip over on its left side. As Employee #1 exited the operator cab  his  right foot inadvertently got trapped between the roll over protective  structure and the road. Employee #1 was transported to Antelope Valley  Hospital and admitted the same day. Employee #1 sustained a below the right  knee amputation as a result of crushing injuries.

201113297, Electric Shock , A painter working for a painting contractor was near the runway conductors for  a 4.5-metric-ton crane. The runway conductors had been deenergized  and the  facility owner and the painting contractor had applied lockout devices to the  energy isolating devices for the circuit. However  someone removed the lockout  devices and reenergized the circuit. The painter contacted the runway  conductors and received an electric shock. He was hospitalized with second-  and third-degree electrical burns to his right thumb and hand.                  
200201267, Electric Shock , Three employees were assigned to construct a 2.4-meter by 3.7-meter office  inside a manufacturing plant that produced steel frames. While the leader of  the crew sawed wood material to size  the other two employees built the  office. After the workers constructed the floor and walls  they started on the  ceiling. They installed one ceiling joist from a ladder; however  they could  not reach the entire ceiling from the ladder. Consequently  they decided to  climb on top of the structure to finish installing the ceiling. The office was  constructed 0.6 meters above the ground  and the employees were working very  close to three 480-volt runway conductors for an overhead crane. The steel  conductors  which remained energized while the employees were working  were  about 1.6 meters above the working surface. The two employees were kneeling on  the structure to install the ceiling. As they were waiting for material from  the crew leader  one of the two employees reached up and contacted a runway  conductor. He was electrocuted.

170751176, Electric Shock , A painter was painting from a 30-ton overhead crane (Model No. 30TON KDBET   Serial No. 4302). The overhead crane was designed with a platform from which  employees could work while operating the crane. Although fall protection was  needed while an employee was working from the crane platform  the employee was  not wearing personal fall arrest equipment. He left the work platform and  accessed the I-beam trolley track of another overhead crane. He reached over  the track and contacted a 277-volt runway conductor for the crane. He received  an electric shock  which knocked him off the structure. He fell 10 feet  3  inches  struck his head on the corner of the crane's lifting hatch  and fell  through the hatch 42 feet  2 inches to the first floor. He died from his  injuries. Investigation revealed that the employee had been trained in and  provided with fall protection; however  he had been working without  supervision. No worksite inspection had been conducted  and the employee had  not been trained in electrical safety-related work practices related to  working around crane runway conductors. (The company had a two-page  written  safety program consisting of 19 work rules.) The employee had been provided  with only 0.5 foot-candles of illumination while he was working from the crane  and the track.

201041357, Employee Fractures Legs When False Car Falls , At approximately 1:45 p.m. on March 12  2003  three employees decided to  disconnect two cables (independent stop-bloc and the safety line) and loop  them over the main unit they were installing. The two cables were held  together with a single Crosby clip. They needed to move the cables in order to  shift the unit over 0.75 inches to get it in line with the installed elevator  tracts  because the cables were in the way. When Employee #1 went to operate  the false car  the employees failed to realize that the cables were no longer  attached to anything  causing the false car to plummet 4.5 stories  (approximately 45 feet). When the brakes were released  the weight bearing  cable was no longer bearing any weight. This caused the false car to plummet  down. The car stopped when the emergency brakes were applied. Employee #1  fractured his legs and was hospitalized.                                        
200800209, Employee'S Arm Lacerated When Manbasket Falls , Employee #1 was in a shop-fabricated manbasket that had been partially lowered  into a 60 ft tall filtration tower using a crane and single-point suspension  scaffold. The top of the basket was attached by a shackle to a 1-ton Wright  overhead crane. This crane was used by the production crew to lift cloth  filters out of the tower and had a predetermined and limited range of lift.  Employee #1 and his supervisor had been briefed by the host company's  maintenance supervisor to use a specific chain hoist to lower the work basket  into the tower. They were also told that a safety rope must be attached to the  basket and anchored at a fixed point to the building structure. Several days  after the briefing  Employee #1 and a coworker used the crane instead of the  chain hoist while sand blasting. They did not encounter any problems  nor did  they attach a safety rope during this operation. While painting the interior  of the tower  they again used the overhead crane without employing a safety  rope. The coworker was operating the crane's pendant controls when Employee #1  asked to be lowered further down. As the coworker did this  the wire rope  reached its maximum length and came off the spool. The basket dropped  approximately 20 ft but stopped short of falling the entire depth of the tower  because the coupling at the wire rope end became stuck in the sheave. Employee  #1 sustained severe lacerations when his arm struck against a piece of metal  attached to the interior of the working basket.                                 
202488755, Employee Is Injured When Struck By Falling Pipe , On March 21  2009  Employee #1 and a coworker were installing a carbon steel  pipe  which measured 6 feet long and had a diameter of 6 inches. In addition   a 90 degree elbow  T-shaped attachment  flanges  and other parts were attached  to the pipe. The pipe  with additional parts  weighed approximately 200 lbs.  The pipe was being supported by a chainfall to keep it from falling  while  Employee #1 and his coworker maneuvered the pipe. While Employee #1 and his  coworker reached the point of installation  the pipe became wedged at an angle  between other pipes and their attachments. This prevented Employee #1 and his  coworker from moving the pipe into the correct position. Employee #1 asked the  coworker to reposition the chainfall in hopes that that would allow them to  move the pipe. As Employee #1 stood below the pipe on a protected catwalk  the  coworker  who was located above Employee #1  repositioned the chainfall. The  chainfall dropped  dislodging the pipe and causing it to fall  striking  Employee #1 and knocking him over the safety railing. Employee #1 was taken to  a nearby hospital  where he was hospitalized and treated for an unspecified  fracture. The accident investigation determined that the coworker failed to  secure the pipe through an alternate means before repositioning the chainfall   allowing the pipe to fall during adjustment.                                    
202573671, Employee Is Injured In Fall From Work Platform , On January 9  2009  Employee #1 and a coworker were working from a scaffolding  platform to install siding.

Within the guardrail system the was an opening for  access/egress of the scaffold platform  which provided an approximate 31 inch  opening that was guarded by two chains with snap hooks to close off the  opening. While Employee #1 and his coworker finished working for the day and  were cleaning up  their supervisor had the platform lowered and removed the  chains guarding the access/egress opening. As the platform was lowered  an  airline had become caught on something. The supervisor instructed Employee #1  move the airline. Employee #1 removed the airline and then stepped backwards   unaware that the access/egress chains had been removed. He fell from the  platform through the opening in the guardrail system and struck his head  against a section of brick that projected from the building  approximately 5  inches  and landed on his right shoulder. Employee #1 was taken by helicopter  to the University of Maryland Hospital  where he was seen by specialists in  their Shock Trauma Unit and treated for a concussion  bruised right shoulder   and bruised upper right arm.

The chokers were attached to the  excavator's bucket hook. During the transfer  the air-tugger shifted to the  right side of the I-beam  causing one of the chokers to slip out of the hook.  The hook was not equipped with a safety latch  and the beam struck a worker.  The worker was hospitalized with several cracked ribs and a bruised hip.        
202360467, Employee'S Fingers Are Injured By Falling Object , On March 27  2006  Employee #1 and a coworker had attached a metal concrete  form (4-ft-wide by 14-ft-long and weighing 800 pounds) to a sling with a hook  that had a safety latch installed. They had lifted one end of the form  approximately 6 ft above the ground and placed supports under that end in  order to spray it with a solution that prevents the concrete from sticking to  the form. When they attempted to lift it again to put it into place in a wall   the hook disengaged due to failure of the safety latch. The form then fell and  pinned Employee #1's leg under it. He was hospitalized for fractures.

The box struck Employee #1 as he was descending a  ladder. The hook on hoist line did not have a safety latch. Employee #1 was  hospitalized.                                                                   
200533990, Employee Is Injured When Scissor Lift Does Not Lower , At approximately 4:30 p.m. on or about December 11  2010  Employee #1 operated  a Skyjack SJM 3219 scissor lift to pull cable. A contracting company other  than Employee #1's employer owned the scissor lift. The scissor lift was not  inspected before use. Employee #1 operated the scissor lift in an elevated  position. Employee #1 leaned over the top rail of the lift and watched the  wheels of the scissor lift. Employee #1 drove the lift forward and traveled  under an evaporator drip pan. Employee #1 toggled the controls out of drive  into lift mode and attempted to lower the lift away from the evaporator drip  pan. Employee #1's body pressed forward on the joystick controller. The lift  went up  instead of down  and Employee #1 was pinned between the lift frame  and the drip pan. Employee #1 pushed the emergency stop button on the scissor  lift. The button did not work. Another employee  a coworker  circled the lift  and looked for emergency lowering controls. The coworker climbed the lift to  hit the emergency stop button. The coworker intended to move the joystick  controller  but could not reach it. The coworker called for help. Employee #1  lost consciousness. The Foreman was alerted and activated the emergency  lowering valve  which lowered the lift and took the pressure off of Employee  #1's body. The Foreman called emergency services and the host company's  project coordinator. Emergency services transferred Employee #1 to a hospital  in an ambulance. Employee #1 sustained broken vertebrae in his neck and had  limited use of one arm due to shoulder damage. Later it was determined that   in addition to the inoperable emergency stop button  the lift/drive enable  push button on the scissor lift did not function properly. The lift/drive  enable push button was designed so that it must be pushed in the entire time  the machine was in motion; if not depressed  the machine would stop. If the  button had been in operation  Employee #1 could have simply lifted his hand  off of the button  and the lift would not have continued to press upward.  Also  the scissor lift had a sticker label that advised how to use the  emergency lowering value  but the sticker was not fully readable. The  emergency lowering value was also difficult to locate; it took a little over  one minute to find the valve. The employer was unable to provide documentation  that Employee #1 received formal training to operate the lift. However  the  employer instructed employees in lift safety during a tool box talk within the  six months prior to the accident.                                               
202486296, Employee'S Hand Crushed By Falling Chiller Unit , On December 27  2007  Employee #1 and two coworkers were lowering a 15 000 lb  chiller that was supported by 6 by 6 wooden blocks onto a concrete pad. Their  intended process was to (1) lower one corner approximately 1-1/2 in. before  moving to the next corner; (2) repeat the process for all four of the corners;  (3) return to the first corner and lower it an additional 1-1/2 in.; (4)  continue with each corner in succession until all four corners were resting on  the concrete pad. To accomplish the task  they used a 10-ton hydraulic jack to  raise one corner high enough to manually replace the 6 by 6 block with a 4 by  4 block  whihc was actually closer to 1-1/2 in. smaller. When all four blocks  were replaced  smaller blocks were to be used as replacements in successive  cycles around the four corners until the chiller was resting on the pad. On  the second corner of the first cycle of block replacements  Employee #1 was  operating the hydraulic jack alone  while the two coworkers were nearby  cleaning up around the chiller. Employee #1 raised the chiller sufficiently to  allow removal of the wooden block when he noticed there was small debris on  the concrete in the area where the chiller would eventually rest. He decided  to scrape it away  but instead of leaving the wooden block in place  he used  it to remove the debris. He was holding the block by its sides and top with  his right hand while he swept away the debris. His fingers were on top of the  block when the jack suddenly collapsed and the chiller dropped on his right  index and middle fingers  crushing them. The two coworkers came to his rescue  and jacked up the chiller to allow Employee #1 to remove his hand. Neither of  the coworkers witnessed the actual accident. Both later stated that they  thought Employee #1 had inadvertently released the relief valve on the jack   causing it to drop the load. The coworker who jacked up the chiller to free  Employee #1's hand later stated that he had to tighten the relief valve before  the pump would raise the jack.

200122869, Employee Killed When Buried By Trench Cave," At approximately 8:45 a.m. on December 19  2007  Employee #1 was installing 8  in. sewer pipe at the bottom of an approximately 20 ft deep trench. Two 10 ft  tall by 20 ft long trench boxes  with 44 in. spreaders  were in use. The  initial excavation was 20 ft deep  but an excavator using a 32 in. shovel had  then dug between the trench boxes to a depth of approximately 22 ft. The  result was that the trench boxes sat on two ""shelves "" each approximately 2 to  3 ft in height. A section of soil  approximately 18 in. wide by 2 to 3 ft deep  by 3 ft long  caved into the trench from the 3 ft high shelf on which the  trench boxes were positioned. The dirt struck Employee #1 on the back of his  legs  knocking him down to his knees. The coworker acting as top man saw the  cave-in and alerted the excavator operator  the foreman  and the loader  operator. The coworker and the loader operator climbed down into the trench  and began shoveling dirt off Employee #1. As they did this  a second cave-in  occurred  coming from the same area. The dirt flowed from under the trench  box  covering Employee #1 over the back of his legs. The two coworkers  continued to shovel for another five minutes and had nearly cleared enough  soil to free him when a third substantial collapse occurred  coming from under  the trench box and from around the front of the east end of the trench boxes.  This collapse engulfed Employee #1 up to his waist and knocked down the  coworker who had witnessed the first cave-in  covering the coworker's legs in  soil  and trapping him as well. The foreman was now also down in the trench   shoveling dirt off the coworker. He was eventually able to pull himself free  of the collapsed soil and then left the trench  exhausted from shoveling.  Rescue personnel from the Sommers Fire Department arrived at the site and took  over rescue operations. A fourth cave-in occurred that replaced the soil  previously removed. The Summers Fire Department called in the SRT Units from  Lake County  IL  for assistance. During the rescue attempt  which lasted over  an hour  soil continued to flow into the trench from beneath the trench box on  the north side and from around the front (east) side of the open-ended trench  box. No protective shielding was in place east of the trench box. The soil was  sloped from about the 15 ft depth level back up to the excavator position   which was about 15 ft to the east. At approximately 10:30 a.m.  a significant  collapse occurred that fully engulfed Employee #1; he died of mechanical  asphyxiation. In a preliminary assessment of the protective measures taken   the top of Employee #1's head was found to be 23 ft below the top of the  trench box. His knees were measured at approximately 25 ft from the top of the  trench box. Tabulated data provided on the trench boxes indicated that they  could be used up to a depth of 35 ft for class A soil  22 ft for class B soil   and 17 ft for class C soil. Preliminary soil classification performed in the  field identified the soil as class C. Clay soil comprised approximately the  top 8 ft  with sand (a class C soil) comprising the bottom layer. Clay soil  located over a C sand soil was classified as a class C soil. Soil samples were  taken from three different locations  including soil excavated during the  recovery. The recovery effort took approximately 13 hours. The top man later  stated that he saw the fissure occur and tried to warn Employee #1 of the  pending cave-in.                                                                "

He was working in a 15 ft deep by 7 ft wide by 16 ft long  trench  when the soil on the west side of the trench caved in and nearly  buried him. Employee #1 was killed. The trench had no form of protection  against the walls collapsing.                                                   
202454120, Employee Injured In Trench Cave, On October 26  2007  Employee #1 and coworkers had been engaged by a homeowner  to construct a retaining wall in the back yard of the residence. The site  presented a 25 ft tall cut face excavation approximately 20 ft in length.  Employee #1 and at least one other coworker were digging with shovels at the  base of the cut face to a level below grade of the existing patio when the cut  face partially collapsed  burying Employee #1 to the top of his head. There  had also been an approximately 6 ft tall Bobcat 463 skid steer loader working  alongside him and it was buried almost to its top. The coworker immediately  began to extract Employee #1 and had uncovered him to about chest level when  the Glendale Fire Department arrived and successfully completed the rescue.  Employee #1 was airlifted to Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center  where he  was admitted. During subsequent investigation it was determined that the  homeowner was not using any sort of cave-in protective measures  and a search  of the DOSH database revealed the homeowner had not obtained a permit from  Division of Occupational Safety and Health to perform the work. The employer  was cited for an accident-related violation  serious  of T8CCR 1541.1(a)  No  cave-in protection on an excavation over 5 ft deep with employee exposure; a  violation  serious  of T8CCR 1541 (k)  Inadequate trench inspection by a  competent person; violations  general  of T8CCR 1509 (a) No Injury and Illness  Prevention Program  of T8CCR 1676 (j ) Improperly built job-made ladder  and  of T8CCR 1509 (c ) No Code of Safe Practices at the work site; and a  violation  regulatory  of T8CCR 341 (d)(5)(A)  No excavation permit prior to  start of the job.

He was rescued and transported to a  trauma hospital  where he died on October 3  2007. The trench had an  inadequate benching protective system. At the location of the cave-in  the  wall was vertical and unprotected on one side; on the other side  the benching  system only went up 6 ft from the bottom of the trench.                         
201573284, Employee Killed In Trench Cave, At approximately 2:00 p.m. on August 4  2007  Employee #1 and coworkers were  working in an 11 ft to 12 ft deep trench with vertical walls. Employee #1 was  in the narrow section of the trench  which was between 2 ft and 2 ft 6 in.  wide  locating and uncovering a pipe connection. A coworker was approximately  20 ft away  watching him  when the north wall of the narrow section collapsed   burying Employee #1. His body was extricated by local emergency responders and  he was pronounced dead at 3:05 p.m. The tench had no form of cave-in  protection.                                                                     
201344454, Employee Killed When Trench Wall Caves In , At approximately 2:30 on July 12  2007  Employee #1 and coworkers were  installing 8 in. diameter PVC sewer pipe in an approximately 8 ft deep trench.  A coworker had just left the trench to get a connector when the entire east  side caved in and buried Employee #1. He was killed. The Morton County  Sheriff  EMS  and Fire Rescue responded to the rescue attempt  but Employee #1  was pronounced dead at the scene. The trench had been neither sloped nor  shored to prevent a trench wall cave-in.                                        
200052991, Employee Killed When Excavation Caves In , At approximately 3:30 p.m. on June 19  2007 Employee #1 was part of a  four-person crew from Midlands Contracting  Inc.  that was installing a sewer  lift station in Imperial  NE. Employee #1 was at the bottom of a 53 ft wide by  150 ft long excavation that had a maximum depth of 37 ft. He was holding an  engineering rod so that a coworker  who was also the superintendent  could  obtain elevation measurements to determine the actual depth. It was decided  that the base of the excavation needed to be leveled so another coworker began  using a Caterpillar 330C excavator to scrape the bottom and remove the excess  earth. The excavator was located on an 18 ft 6 in. deep ramp on the north end  of the excavation. Employee #1 was still in the excavation when the east wall  caved in. The initial collapse covered him up to his knees and he stated that  he would extricate himself using a hand shovel. Within 30 seconds  a second  collapse occurred that completely engulfed him. Employee #1 died of asphyxia.  Subsequent investigation found the upper portions of the excavation on the  west and south side were sloped. The east wall was previously excavated and  had not been sloped due to the location of the old lift station on its border.  The north side contained the ramp that that held the excavator. Causal factors  in the accident were the failure to properly apply protective  anti-cave-in  systems. This was exacerbated by vibrations caused by the excavator  which was  in use while Employee #1 was still working within the excavation. The failure  to remove the existing sewer lift station also caused the excavation to be  unstable because the slab for the building had been undermined.                 
202341798, Employee Killed When Trench Caves In , At approximately 2:40 p.m. on May 4  2007  Employee #1 was digging a trench  with two other workers to uncover a wall that was leaking from the rain. He  was going to waterproof the wall to stop the leak. The trench was  approximately 10 feet deep by 11 feet long by 4 feet wide. It had no shoring  and the walls were vertical. The trench wall collapsed  burying and  asphyxiating Employee #1. It took approximately two hours for rescue workers  to dig him out and the medical examiner pronounced him dead on the scene.       
170888812, Employee Injured When Elevated Lift Rolls Off Barge , Employee #1  who worked for a contractor at the work site  was in the basket  of a self-propelled  two-wheel drive  JLG lift  model BONX  serial #  030878063.  patching rough areas of new concrete.

He was not utilizing any type of fall protection. The  owner was giving the crane operator hand signals while Employee #1 was at the  rear of the structure standing on a top sill. As he reached out to grab the  truss and position it into place  the truss swung and struck Employee #1   causing him to fall 22 ft to the ground  striking his shoulder on a stake.  Employee #1 was hospitalized for a large laceration.                            
201991924, Employee Electrocuted In Contact With Energized Standpipe , On August 9  2005  Employee #1 and three coworkers  of Rick Thomas Roofing   Inc.  were installing three-tab shingles on a house. Employee #1 contacted an  energized standpipe and was electrocuted.                                       
896431, Employee Injured When Burned By Hot Water , Employee #1 was placing a spent oxygen cylinder into a pick-up truck when a  standpipe for a condensate tank overflowed. He sustained burns from the hot  water  for which he was hospitalized..                                          
14543961, Employee Dies Of Asphyxia After Explosion In Standpipe , Employee #1 was removing a section of pipe while working within an  approximately 75 ft high by 4 ft diameter standpipe that was part of a 250 000  gallon water tank. He was using an oxy-acetylene torch to cut away bolts when  an explosion and fire occurred. Employee #1 died of asphyxia.                   
14299069, Employee Injured In Fall Inside 90 Ft Standpipe , Employee #1  age 17  and coworkers were suspended in bosun's chairs painting  the inside of a water tank. This was a confined space subject to the  accumulation of flammable vapors that could affect the central nervous system  of exposed individuals. After painting for several hours  Employee #1 and a  coworker  who were wearing air-line respirators  entered the tank through its  top opening. Once down at the base of the tank  they began re-rigging their  bosun's chairs as necessary. Employee #1 had trouble seeing through the  paint-spattered lens of his respirator  so he removed it. He was told to put  his respirator back on  but did not. A coworker who entered the tank to make  Employee #1 put the respirator back on was also unsuccessful. The two  coworkers then exited the tank while Employee #1 remained inside  unprotected  against the paint vapors. He removed a grate covering the tank's 90 ft tall  and 4 ft diameter standpipe and began descending a fixed ladder into it. While  descending the ladder Employee #1 became overwhelmed by the vapors and lost  consciousness  falling as much as 90 ft. Because of the standpipe's narrow  diameter  Employee #1 landed feet first onto sand that had accumulated at the  base during sandblasting operations. The owner extracted him through the  opening at the base of the standpipe. Employee #1 sustained numerous injuries  to his body systems in addition to a compound fracture to his right leg. He  was transported to Dorchester General Hospital  where he was treated for his  injuries.                                                                       
564195, Employee Drowns When Trapped In Confined Space , Employee #1 was moving and reinstalling concrete forms inside a very confined  space that was about 4 ft by 6 1/2 ft by 9 ft high. A 20 ft high standpipe  with an outside diameter of 32 1/4 in. was in the middle of the space. The  standpipe was over a section of pipe that was connecting this space to a 100  ft diameter by 20 ft deep water tank. Employee #1 apparently removed some  bracing  causing the standpipe to tilt over against some rebar and break the  seal at the bottom. The employee was trapped. He could not get around the  sides of the pipe and the top had fallen over above him. Water from the tank  and the standpipe rushed in and drowned the employee.                           
201798881, Employee Sustains Head Injury In Fall From Roof , At approximately 3:00 p.m. on August 5  2004  Employee #1  a carpenter  and  two coworkers of the First Class Construction were working at a new  construction site. Employee #1 was using a staple gun to sheet the roofing.  Employee #1 was facing West and was working from South to North  when he  failed to notice an uncovered skylight opening. Employee #1 fell 12 ft to the  concrete floor. He sustained head trauma and was hospitalized in USC Medical  Center for 13 days. Employee #1 did not receive any safety training.            
201798659, Employee Injures Eye While Operating Stapler Tool , At approximately 1:30 p.m. on May 3  2004  Employee #1 and three coworkers  were installing insulation at a new single family home. He was using a Hammer  Tacker hand stapler  Model Number HT-550  to fasten the insulation to the wood  framing of a wall. One of the staples bounced back  due to a knot in the wood   and struck Employee #1 in the left eye. He was transported to USC Medical  Center  where he was hospitalized and underwent surgery. The accident  investigation revealed that the accident could have avoided if Employee #1 was  wearing eye protection  which was recommend by the manufacturer of stapler  tool.                                                                           
200611952, Employee'S Finger Is Injured When Caught In Machinery , On July 21  2005  Employee #1 was working to clean out the grout mixer/pump  end of a machine while a coworker operated the machine's on/off controls.  Employee #1's finger became caught and injured in a pinch point. No lockout or  tagout procedures were being used.                                              
202315479, Employee Shocked Pulling Cable To Junction Box , Some time before 2:45 p.m. on August 2  2005  Employee #1 was pulling MC cable  to be connected to junction boxes when he was shocked by an energized 277-volt  circuit. He was sent to the clinic after the accident  where he was treated  and released the same day. There were no signs of an electrical burn from the  shock and his EKG result was good. Witnesses could find neither a high- nor a  low-voltage power source when they tested the circuit. It was speculated that  there may have been a very rare instance of capacitive discharge of the  battery backup fixtures on the night light circuit  or that a static charge  from working on the carpet may have discharged to a grounded surface (cable)  in the ceiling. The company's work was already completed when Employee #1 went  to the job site.

The  employee began to cut a pipe hanger holding 30 feet by 6 inch section of pipe  in place from a steam line pole. The top end of the pipe moved from its  position striking an energized overhead power lines that was approximately 7  to 9 feet from the employee's location. The line contacted the employee   resulting in the electrocution of the employee from the contact it made with  the pipe.                                                                       
201562576, Employees Are Burned By Steam Inside Tunnel , On November 1  2010  Employees #1 through #11 were working in a new section of  utility tunnel on the University of Utah campus. A power failure at the High  Temperature Water Plant caused a valve to open and release water that had been  heated to a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Steam then traveled  throughout the old and new sections of the tunnel system  burning all 11  employees. Employees #1 through #3 were hospitalized. The others were treated  for minor burns.                                                                
201153426, Employee Burns His Foot While Steam Cleaning , On April 7  2000  Employee #1  a temporary laborer  sustained second-degree  burns of his right foot when he inadvertently placed a hot steam nozzle into  the top of his right boot as he was walking along. At the time of the accident  he was high pressure steam cleaning the concrete floor in a steel mill. He was  hospitalized.                                                                   
201858719, Two Employees Are Burned By Steam , On October 18  2005  six employees were working to bring a steam unit online.  When an expansion joint failed  steam blew out onto the employees. Employees  #1 and #2 were hospitalized with burns.                                         
170390587, Employee Killed When Steam Line Ruptured , On October 10  2002  Employee #1 entered into a confined space  a manhole   without initiating any lockout or tag out procedures  and attempted to repair  a high pressure  high temperature  steam trap line. Employee #1 apparently had  tried to remove the trap and was moving within the manhole and apparently  struck an internally deteriorated blow down line  causing it to separate from  the steam line and releasing 700 to 800 degree Fahrenheit  250 p.s.i. steam  into the confined space. This resulted in blowing Employee #1 out of the  manhole  and his receiving third degree full thickness burns over 95 percent  of his body. Employee #1 died approximately 10 hours later at the hospital.     
202544300, Employee Is Struck And Crushed By Large Metal Beam , At approximately 2:25 a.m. on October 11  2012  Employee #1 was working on an  infrastructure construction project to widen a freeway. Employee #1  a rigger   was involved in the loading of 26 ft long steel I-beams onto a trailer. Each  I-beam weighted approximately 2 800 pounds. A coworker used a Komatsu 400  excavator to move the I-beams. Employee #1 stood on the ground between the  trailer and a K-rail (as known as a Jersey barrier) and was approximately 3 ft  away from the trailer. As the excavator rotated  its counterweight contacted  another I-beam on the trailer  knocking it off. Employee was struck and  crushed by the I-beam. The cause of the accident was due to failure in  ensuring that exposed employees were not working in the zone of danger  adjacent to the trailer containing steel the I-beams.                           
201703592, Employee'S Ankle Is Struck By Beam And Is Fractured , On September 22  2012  Employee #1 was walking between two steel I-beams to  retreive an extension cord. As she reached for the extension cord  one of the  I-beam suddenly tipped over and fell upon her ankle  fracturing it. Employee  #1 was transported to a medical center  where she underwent medical procedures  and was hospitalized for postoperative care.                                    
202544185, Employee Falls From Ladder And Is Injured , At approximately 5:45 p.m. on August 14  2012  Employee #1 and coworkers were  fabricating and installing structural steel within a building. After the  installation of an I-Beam with a crane and the removal of the crane from the  worksite  employees discovered that the I-Beam was 3 ft too long. This error  would delay the entire project and need to be fixed  so a decision was made to  cut the I-Beam in place with onsite tools. Employee #1 and two coworkers  planned to cut the I-beam to the proper size in place at the main level  which  was located on the north side of the building. They collected equipment for  accomplishing the task  which including an oxy-fuel torch and a ladder;  however  they did not gather a hoist  rope or chain fall to lower the cut  section of the I-Beam. They decided to place lumber under the I-beam to  protect the finished concrete deck and allow the I-beam to free fall to the  lumber deck. Employee #1 positioned himself on the self-supporting ladder  below and to the side of the I-Beam. One coworker  the foreman  was below and  to the side of the I-beam and on the concrete deck observing him. Employee #1  began to cut 3 ft from the end of the I-beam. After cutting the I-beam  section  which weighted 135 pounds  it fell 10.75 ft onto the lumber  protecting the concrete deck. The I-beam struck the lumber and rebounded   striking and shaking Employee #1's ladder. Employee #1 fell 4 ft onto the  deck. He sustained fractured fingers and a fractured wrist in the fall.  Employee #1 was transported to a medical center  where he received treatment  and was hospitalized for postoperative care.                                    
202561296, Employee Is Injured In Fall From Steel Joist , On September 13  2011  Employee #1 and Coworker #1 were working as  steelworkers. Employee #1 and Coworker #1 were setting a rack of steel joists  (three joists welded together with bridging) on to two steel girders and two  joists  located approximately 34 feet above the ground. Employee #1 was  walking from the west girder to the south joist  and was tied off to the joist  using a beamer and a six foot lanyard. Coworker #1 was operating a JLG boom  lift and was raising the work platform to Employee #1  who was located in the  middle of the joist. Coworker #1 contacted the joist with the boom lift  and  displaced the joist rack. The joist rack tipped and flipped over and struck  the concrete flooring below. Employee #1 fell with the joist  and hit the  concrete flooring. Employee #1 suffered multiple unspecified serious injuries.  
202529608, Worker Breaks Arm In Fall From Steel Column , At approximately 2:45 p.m. on April 14  2009  Employee #1  a journeyman  ironworker of Riverton Steel Construction  was landing a steel beam. He was  climbing a column at a two story steel framed building and fell 30 feet to the  ground striking a metal cross beam during the fall. Employee #1 was  hospitalized and treated for a broken right arm and contusions to the lower  back.                                                                           
200758720, Employee Is Killed When Steel Column Falls , At approximately 12:30 p.m. on October 7  2008  An employee was working as a  ground man and was assisted by a coworker  also a ground man  where a steel  column was being rigged on the ground and was to be hoisted and set in place  on a concrete foundation. A rubber tired  Grove RT 745 Crane was being used to  assist in the rigging process. A lifting mechanism that consisted of a choker   shackle  ropes and a cotter pin was being used. Based on the task at hand  the  ground man would have attached the hinge pin through the shackle and then  through the column splice lug hole and back through the other side of the  shackle hole. A cotter pin would then be placed through the end tip of the  hinge pin. A nylon rope would also be attached to the handle side of the hinge  pin. Another nylon rope would be connected to the cotter pin so that when the  steel column was erected  the rope would be pulled  the cotter pin would fall  out and then the rope connected to the hinge pin would be pulled and that  portion of the rigging apparatus would fall to the ground. The investigation  revealed that during the initial set up  the cotter pin was placed down side  up; so if the rope is pulled  the pin would not pop out. The coworker signaled  the crane operator to begin the lift. As the column was being raised  the  ground man noticed the inverted cotter pin and motioned the crane operator to  stop. At that time  the ground man adjusted the cotter pin and motioned the  crane operator to continue the lift. The rigging connection released from the  column shortly after the column was hoisted to about a 45 degree angle. The  mechanism had been placed under and not through the splice lug hole. The  employee was killed when a 44.2 foot steel column  weighing about 2 300 lbs  fell on him. The coworker stated that he did not notice that the rigging  connection was not connected through the splice lug hole on the steel column.  There was no work rule in place to address specific rigging procedures when  erection operations involved rigging steel columns and beams hoisting said  items. Also  there was no documentation that employees who performed rigging  work were trained on implementing safe rigging connections when steel columns  were being hoisted and set in place. The weather at the time of the accident  was clear and sunny with no precipitation.                                      
170839773, Employee Fractures Ribs In Fall Descending Steel Column , At approximately 3:13 p.m. on October 10  2007  Employee #1  an iron worker  for Mid-State Steel Erectors  Inc.  was shinning down a column when he lost  his grip and stepped backward  falling 16 ft onto a deck. He fractured three  ribs  for which he was hospitalized.                                            
201071438, Employee Injured In Fall When Vertical Column Shifts , At approximately 2:30 p.m. on September 17  2007  Employee #1  a steel worker  with International Iron Products  was helping to erect vertical columns at a  building site. Employee #1 was working alongside a coworker and had finished  with two of the four anchor bolts used to secure a vertical column to the  concrete slab. Before the remaining two anchor bolts could be completed  he  climbed the pole to release the hoisting noose. Employee #1 was on his way  down the column when it tilted and he was thrown off  landing on the concrete  slab. He sustained fractures in both arms and was transported to the hospital   where he underwent surgery to place a pin in his left forearm.                  
200881316, Employee Fractures Spine In Fall From Steel Column , On April 27  2007  a steel erection crew was installing structural steel at an  addition for a hospital. The crew consisted of a foreman  crane operator   rigger  and two connectors. Employee #1 was one of the connectors. The day was  cool and dry  though it had rained the night before. Employee #1 was  performing his regularly assigned job of erecting structural steel. While  climbing a steel column from a height of approximately 13.8 ft to a height of  approximately 17.5 ft above the ground  Employee #1 fell from the column.  Employee #1 was wearing a harness and lanyard  but there was no attachment  point for the fall protection system. Ladders could have been used to access  the work area since there was the existing building within inches of three of  the four columns that the employees had to access. Also  there was room for an  aerial lift. Employee #1 received multiple injuries including fractures to the  spine. Employee #1 was hospitalized.                                            
170761563, Employee Is Crushed And Killed By Falling Steel Beam , On February 26  2007  a subcontractor and his two employees were installing a  steel I-beam  and steel columns  in the middle of a building and running the  length of the building. The building was a one-story  35-ft wide  165-ft long  wood post building. Three forklifts and operators working for the company that  owned the building were assisting in the erection of the steel. They bolted  two 26-ft 7-in. long  by 13.75-in.  by 5-in. I-beams together. Two of the  forklifts elevated the beam to where it was to be installed. As they held the  beam in place  the subcontractor employees positioned and erected three 16-ft  long  6-in. by 6-in. columns vertically (one at a time). This was done  manually. As they held the columns in place their employer bolted the beam to  the columns. The subcontract employer did this while standing on a pallet on  the forks of the third fork lift. One of the two forklifts used to elevate the  steel was inadequate. It did not have enough reach to elevate the beam to the  16-ft high area. The operator had hoisted the beam on the back-rail rather  than on the forks. After the third column was bolted to the beam  the other  forklift left its position. The operator was going after some bracing. The  steel was now being held in position only by the one forklift that had the  beam resting on its back-rail. The concrete foundations for the columns had  not been poured and no anchor pins or leveling devices had been installed. The  beam slipped off the back-rail of the forklift and fell over onto the concrete  floor. The beam struck and crushed Employee #1  an employee of the  subcontractor. Employee #1 was killed.                                          
201561735, Employee Is Killed When Struck By Falling Column , On October 4  2006  Employee #1 was working for MIJ Corporation  setting a  steel column at a building under construction at the Bandanna Ranch Airport. A  forklift with a nylon strap was being used. Employee #1 was killed when the  strap broke and he was struck by the column when it fell.                       
201148079, Employee Is Struck In Face As Column Being Installed Shifts , On June 12  2006  Employee #1 was working for a structural steel fabricator  and erector. He was at a shopping mall construction site in Irvine  CA. The  company was erecting columns in front of a building structure. Employee #1 was  working as an iron worker. His coworker  the site superintendent  was working  as a boom operator  and Employee #1 was directing him. They were installing a  circular column approximately 6 inches in diameter and 28 feet tall. As the  boom operator aligned the column flange and set it down onto the base anchor  bolts  the flange jammed. Employee #1  holding the column  signaled the boom  operator to raise the column slightly. As the boom operator inched the column  up  it suddenly sprang off the studs and struck Employee #1 in the face.  Employee #1 sustained blunt trauma injuries to his head  a nose fracture  and  lacerations to his face. He was hospitalized for those injuries and for  treatment for bruises  contusions  and abrasions. Employee #1 was a full-time  payroll employee with no other contracts.                                       
202443453, Employee'S Leg Is Fractured By Falling Column , At approximately 8:45 a.m. on May 17  2006  Employee #1  of D & D Welding  was  manually moving a 500-lb steel column with a coworker  when the column slipped  from the coworker's hands and fell through the elevator hoist opening. The end  Employee #1 was holding raised and then lowered. Employee #1 reacted by  letting go of his end  grabbing onto the floor so that he would not fall down  the shaft. The column struck his leg  fracturing the tibia. He was admitted to  El Rancho Springs Medical Center.                                               
202451753, Two Employees Fracture Legs When Steel Column Falls , On October 4  2005  Employees #1 and #2 were working for a firm erecting wide  flange  square tube structural steel for a two-story  single family  residential construction project. The first story structure had been  completed. The columns had been secured by anchor bolts  but the beams were  held in place by temporary tack welds. The on-site supervisor then directed  that the second-story columns be put in place before the temporary tack welds  were replaced with permanent welds. This is the normal practice. At one point   a column for the second level was bolted to a beam in error  and a crane was  needed to remove it. Employee #1 placed a ladder against the column and  climbed it with a choker sling. His weight and that of the ladder against the  column broke the tack welds holding its supporting beam. The beam rotated away  from Employee #1  causing the ladder to fall with the column and its beam.  Employee #1 jumped off the ladder a distance of about 10 feet to the cement  pad below. He sustained a fracture to his right leg. Employee #2  working on  the ground near the base of the ladder but with his back to the event   sustained a fracture to the left leg  as well as other injuries. Employee #1  was hospitalized  but there is no injury line for Employee #2. The main causal  factor for this accident was inadequate bracing of the column.                  
200271369, Employee Is Killed When Struck By Falling Steel Beam , Two employees were moving a steel component of the spray painting system being  installed. One employee was operating the crane traveling with the component.  Employee #1 jumped on the outside of the crane and was riding next to the cab.  The crane boom struck a steel beam attached to two steel columns anchored to  the floor. The column anchors were pulled from the floor as the beam and  columns fell. The beam struck the Employee #1 resulting in his death.

201955523, Employee Is Exposed To Electrical Flush Burn , On May 2  2008  Employee #1 was exposed to the electrical flush burn  when he  was entering an electrical switch  without locking out the energy source. He  was not injured.                                                                
201521234, Burn , An electrical contractor dispatched an electrician and an apprentice to a town  center mall to repair a defective 200-ampere fusible disconnect in a  low-voltage main distribution switchboard. In preparation  the employees  deenergized a 200-ampere electric power and lighting panelboard located on the  second level of the mall. The panelboard was fed by the defective disconnect   which had an open pole. Next  the electrician (Employee #1) opened the  disconnect switch  disconnected the load-side 3/0 AWG conductors  and  reconnected then to a 400-ampere disconnect in an adjacent section of the  switchgear. The electrician discovered that the A-phase internal bus hardware  of the defective 200-ampere switch  including the fuse holder  was discolored  from long-term overheating. This was similar to a problem he had encountered  less than a month ago at another 200-ampered fusible disconnect within the  same low-voltage switchboard. The problem with that disconnect  which was  directly above the disconnect on which he was working that day  was also on  the A-phase. Upon completion of these tasks  the electrician closed only the  400-ampere disconnect and called his employer to explain what he had found.  The employer (Employee #3) and the mechanical superintendent of the mall  (Employee #2) met the electrician at the switchboard. After explaining to them  his findings and making a recommendation to replace the defective switches or  to consider upgrading the entire service entrance switchgear  the electrician  closed the door to the switch he had deactivated that day. As he was closing  the door of the other defective switch  an electrical fault occurred. The  ensuing electric arc burned the two employees and the employer and knocked  them to the floor. They were able to crawl out of the room. The two employees  were hospitalized for their injuries.                                           
200840320, Burn , On February 24  1998  during the construction of a hospital expansion  two  journeyman electricians and an apprentice electrician were modifying the  existing main 480-volt switchboard to add a new switchboard cubicle. The  apprentice was not actively involved in the installation work and was  observing from a distance. The switchboard was energized while the  electricians were making the modifications. Both employees were wearing Class  1 rubber insulating gloves with leather protectors. After installing supports  for the new cubicle and three Z-bar bus extensions onto the three bus bars   they lifted the new cubicle into place in the unit. An electrical fault  occurred  and the ensuing electric arc burned both electricians  knocked them  backwards  and ignited their clothing. Both electricians were hospitalized  with second- and third-degree burns over 60 percent of their bodies. One of  them died 28 days after the accident. The apprentice received minor burns on  his right arm assisting the two injured electricians. (This injured employee  was not listed on an injury line on the original form.)                         
170748610, Burn , Two employees of an electrical contractor were removing a 225-ampere circuit  breaker from a 1600-ampere  277/480-volt  Square D switchboard. The employees  had not deenergized the switchboard before starting the job  nor were they  wearing personal protective equipment. Employee #1 was performing the task   kneeling in front of the switchboard. Employee #2 was kneeling to his left. An  electrical fault occurred  and the ensuing electric arc burned the two  employees and ignited their clothing. Employee #l received burns to his chest   face  and arms. He died from his injuries. Employee #2 received burns to his  right side  and he burned his hands from putting out the fire on himself and  his coworker.                                                                   
170053284, Burn , An electrician was repairing a 480-volt switchboard. An electrical fault  occurred in the switchboard  and the ensuing electric arc burned the employee  on his face and hands. He was hospitalized for his injuries.                    
568428, Electric Shock , Two electricians were working on a switchboard in a vault. The employees were  going to connect a new switch to an existing switch. They were pulling a  5000-volt shielded conductor through an 8.5-inch-diameter conduit. As one of  the electricians reached into the switchboard to pull the conductor through  the conduit  the conductor caught on a bushing. An electric arc occurred  and  the employee contacted an energized part. He was electrocuted. He was  transported to a hospital  where he was pronounced dead on arrival.             
170696181, Burn , An electrician was installing a circuit breaker in a three-phase  480-volt  switchboard. The employee was not wearing electrical protective equipment. An  electrical fault occurred  and the employee was burned on the backs of his  hands  on the insides of his wrists  and on the upper part of his left arm by  the ensuing electric arc. He was hospitalized for his injuries.                 
170606248, Electric Shock , An electrician was performing work on a partially energized 480-volt  switchboard at a waste water treatment plant. He was replacing a  5-kilovolt-ampere  480/120-volt transformer in the switchboard. He contacted a  480-volt conductor that was supposed to have been taped and protected against  contact. The electrician received a severe electric shock and was knocked  unconscious. He was hospitalized for his injury but returned to work the next  day.                                                                            
170245310, Burn , A power line foreman (employee #2) had deenergized and removed fuses from a  switchboard. He buzzed the lower parts of the fuseholders and found them to be  deenergized. The top parts were still energized. He sent a power line worker  back to the shop for a high-voltage detector and grounds to ensure that the  deenergized part remained deenergized. The foreman then told an apprentice  power line worker (employee #1) to take a break  while the foreman got some  rubber insulating blankets to insulate the tops of the fuseholders. When the  foreman turned to get the protective equipment  the apprentice grabbed a cable  and pulled it up from the bottom of the switchboard. The top of the cable  for  a length of about 4 inches  flipped over and contacted the top of one of the  fuseholders. This caused a phase-to-ground fault  which developed into a  phase-to-phase fault. The ensuing electric arc burned the foreman and the  apprentice. The employees were hospitalized for their injuries.                 
609388, Electric Shock , AN ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR AND ONE OF HIS EMPLOYEES WERE INSTALLING TRANSFORMERS  AND WIRING FOR A SWITCHBOARD. THEY HAD INSTALLED CONDUIT AND PULLED SOME  CONDUCTORS. THE EMPLOYEE CONNECTED THE CONDUCTORS TO THE SWITCHBOARD. HE THEN  TOUCHED A 277-VOLT  1200-AMPERE BUS BAR WITH HIS HAND AND RECEIVED AN ELECTRIC  SHOCK. THE CONTRACTOR OVERHEAD THE ACCIDENT AND ASSISTED THE INJURED EMPLOYEE.  IN SPITE OF THE RESCUE ATTEMPTS  THE EMPLOYEE DIED OF ELECTROCUTION.            
170717672, Burn , AT ABOUT 6:05 PM ONE EVENING  AN ELECTRICAL FOREMAN WAS PREPARING A SIEMENS  ITE 480 SWITCHBOARD FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THREE NEW SWITCHES. HE HAD BEEN  DIRECTED NOT TO DEENERGIZE THE CIRCUITS UNTIL AFTER 6:15 PM THAT NIGHT. WHILE  THE CIRCUITS WERE STILL ENERGIZED  HE USED A RATCHET WRENCH IN MODIFYING THE  LOWER BRACKETS OF THE SWITCHBOARD. THE WRENCH SLIPPED AND CONTACTED AN  ENERGIZED PART IN THE SWITCHBOARD. THE RESULTING ELECTRICAL FAULT CAUSED AN  ELECTRIC ARC  BURNING THE FOREMAN DOING THE WORK AND ANOTHER ELECTRICAL  FOREMAN IN THE AREA. ONE OF THEM SUSTAINED FIRST  SECOND  AND THIRD DEGREE  BURNS TO HIS FACE  CHEST  HANDS  AND FOREARMS. THE OTHER EMPLOYEE SUSTAINED  FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO HIS FACE  NECK  HANDS  AND FOREARMS. BOTH  EMPLOYEES WERE HOSPITALIZED FOR THEIR INJURIES.                                 
170072151, Burn , AN ELECTRICAL FAULT OCCURRED IN A SWITCHBOARD  AND THE ENSUING ELECTRIC ARC  BURNED A POWER LINE WORKER. HE DIED AS A RESULT OF HIS INJURIES.                
201859295, Three Employees Burned In Electric Arc Blast , At approximately 1:30 p.m. on January 29  2008  Employees #1 through #3 were  at the switchgear in the basement of a hospital. They were using a Fluke  multi-meter to test a 4 000-amp circuit breaker when an arc flash occurred.  All three employees sustained second- and third-degree burns  and were  hospitalized.                                                                   
201039666, Employee Shocked While Working On Wiring In Switchgear Box , At approximately 2:35 p.m. on November 7  2007  Employee #1  of the Technical  Resource Center in Santa Ana  CA  was contracted to DCI Electric  Inc.  and  was working at the Warren E&P; petroleum reclamation site in Wilmington  CA. At  the time of the accident  he was working on the backside of a 277/480-volt  ASE-Sierra Micro Turbine switchgear box that controlled the vertical  north/south pumps at the reclamation site. Employee #1 was passing control  wires from the front of the box to the back when the wiring accidentally  touched an energized part and he became frozen to the buss. A coworker  dislodged Employee #1 and called 911. Employee #1 was given CPR at the site  and was transported to Kaiser Harbor General Hospital  where he was admitted  at 3:03 p.m. for treatment. He recovered and was discharged the next evening  at 10:57 p.m.                                                                   
201262094, Employee Suffers Fatal Burns In Arc Flash , On November 13  2006  Employee #1  a journeyman electrician  was inside an  energized electrical substation cubicle  cleaning a switch gear. The input  voltage to the equipment was 12 600 volts AC. Employee #1 had recently  installed the equipment and it was about to undergo testing by a  representative of the cubicle's manufacturer in order to be released for use  by the Chicago Transit Authority to supply power to the third rail on a length  of elevated train tracks. An arc flash/blast occurred  setting off a chain  reaction between the three electrical phase connections on the cubicle where  the circuit breaker switch gear coupled to the cubicle (and would normally  complete the circuit to the load). Employee #1 sustained severe burns and was  transported to the hospital  where he died two days later. At the time of the  accident  Employee #1 had been working for 18 months on power distribution  equipment. Three coworkers were in the area when the arc fault occurred  but  they were standing outside the flash protection boundary. At the time this  report was written  the Cook County Medical Examiner was still investigating  the accident and suspected that current flow through Employee #1's body had  also contributed to his death.                                                  
171018120, Electric Shock , A power line crew was working on a deenergized 230-kilovolt overhead power  line that ran parallel to an energized 500-kilovolt line. A seventh-step  apprentice on the crew was on the wood pole support structure  setting up a  grounding bracket. After driving the ground rod  another crewmember sent the  ground wire up to the apprentice  who connected it to the grounding bracket.  The apprentice then connected a shorter grounding jumper to the bracket and  passed the other end to a journeyman power line worker above him on the pole.  The journeyman fuzzed the line and got no indication of nominal voltage. When  the journeyman tried to connect the grounding jumper to the deenergized  conductor  he missed and drew an electric arc from induced voltage on the  conductor. The journeyman successfully connected the jumper on his second  attempt. He then looked down and saw the apprentice holding onto the grounding  bracket with his glove on fire. The employee had received an electric shock  and was apparently unconscious. The crew performed a pole top rescue and  summoned emergency medical services. The apprentice was hospitalized for his  injuries.                                                                       
170336358, Electric Shock , A communications worker was working from the bucket of an aerial lift   repairing a telephone cable supported by a utility pole. The ground wire on  the pole was energized at 440 volts  and the employee was electrocuted when he  touched it with his finger.                                                     
14419980, Electric Shock , A plumber was using a pipe wrench to remove a water line from a toilet. The  water line was energized because of faulty wiring. The employee was  electrocuted as he was turned the pipe with the wrench.                         
170719710, Electric Shock , A plumber's helper was grounding an electrical enclosure mounted on the  exterior of a residential garage. The enclosure was a 100-ampere meter box  made by Federal Pacific (Model or Serial No. MB-112-20-SF) mounted 48 inches  above the ground. The employee had installed the copper rod grounding  electrode and had attached an 8 AWG uninsulated conductor to it. As he was  molding the wire to the contour of the building  the other end of the  conductor snaked its way under the box cover through the hinge slot and  contacted the 120/240-volt meter bus. The employee received an electric shock.  Emergency medical services checked the employee and advised him to see a  doctor. The employee was subsequently admitted to a hospital for his injury.  (The employee had been instructed to carry out this task by a local building  inspector.)                                                                     
890475, Electric Shock , An employee of a plumbing and heating contractor was working from a  6-foot-high aluminum ladder  assembling a gas pipe to an overhead gas heater.  As he was working  he received an electric shock. The aluminum ladder was  sitting on top of a 100-foot extension cord set that was connected to a  four-way outlet not protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter. He had  been using an electric drill earlier that day  and it was still connected to  the cord set. The employee was transported to a hospital and was released the  same day. His only remaining symptoms of the electric shock were soreness in  most of the muscles in his body.                                                
170194138, Electric Shock , An electrical contractor had been hired by a mobile home owner to determine  why the owner was receiving electric shocks from the outside piping. An  electrician with about 4 years of experience was assigned the job. The  employee determined that the trailer frame and the piping were energized at  120 volts. He crawled under the trailer to look for faulty wiring. As he was  crawling under the trailer  he passed over a copper refrigerant line that was  also energized. The employee was electrocuted. An inspection of the main  panelboard discovered that the main bonding jumper was missing.                 
800243, Electric Shock , Two employees were installing optical-fiber cable between two electric power  transmission towers supporting a 230-kilovolt overhead power line. One of the  employees was on the ground  and the other was on the top of one of the  towers. The employee on the tower pulled the optical-fiber cable from one side  of the tower to the other and began to lower the cable. As he was lowering the  cable  a loop formed  and it hung up between the lower tower arm and the  ground wire. The employee climbed down to the lower arm to free the optical  cable. However  instead of pulling the loop up and over the ground wire  he  took the clip for the ground wire off the tower arm. He was electrocuted by  induced voltage in the ground wire. The employee on the ground went up the  tower to assist the injured employee and received an electric shock. He was  hospitalized for this injury for a period of 2 days.                            
14492706, Electric Shock , A JOB SUPERINTENDENT WAS INSTALLING INSULATION ON A STEEL TANK AT AN OIL  REFINERY CONSTRUCTION SITE. HE WAS USING A 120-VOLT ELECTRIC PENCIL GRINDER TO  GRIND RUST OFF THE TANK SO THAT PINE COULD BE TACKED TO THE TANK TO HOLD THE  INSULATION. WHEN THE STEP-DOWN TRANSFORMER WAS CONNECTED TO THE 480-VOLT   THREE-PHASE-DELTA POWER SUPPLY  THE EQUIPMENT GROUNDING CONDUCTOR BECAME  ENERGIZED AT 480 VOLTS. (THE REPORT DID NOT STATE WHEN THIS CONNECTION WAS  MADE.) WHEN THE EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT ARM TOUCHED THE METAL TANK WITH THE GRINDER  IN HIS LEFT HAND  HE WAS ELECTROCUTED.                                          
14489819, Electric Shock , AN EMPLOYEE WAS TRYING TO FREE A GROUND WIRE EMBEDDED IN A CONCRETE SLAB. THE  CONCRETE SLAB WITH THE GROUND WIRE IN IT WAS RAISED BY A BACKHOE. THIS CAUSED  THE GROUND WIRE TO BE PULLED DOWNWARD APPROXIMATELY 18 INCHES AND CAUSED THE  GROUNDING CLAMP TO BECOME SEPARATED FROM THE NEUTRAL. THE GROUND WIRE  CONTACTED THE 2400-VOLT PHASE LINE. WHEN THE EMPLOYEE BROKE THE WIRE  HE  BECAME PART OF THE CIRCUIT AND WAS ELECTROCUTED.                                
202545091, Employee Amputates Thumb On Table Saw , At approximately 2:00 p.m. on May 23  2013  Employee #1  a finish carpenter   was working for a contractor and cutting plywood on a Powermatic table saw  (Model Number 66 TA  Serial Number 04030660608) at a construction site. The  construction site was of a new single family dwelling. As he was cutting 2 in.  strips into an 8 ft long piece of plywood  his left thumb contacted the blade  of the saw and amputated it. The table saw was unguarded. He was in a  partially completed two-car garage working alone. A coworker was working in  the kitchen area. Employee #1 was transported to a medical center  where he  received treatment and underwent surgery on the amputated thumb. After  undergoing medical procedures  he was hospitalized for postoperative care.      
201504354, Employee Sustains Amputation By Nylon Tag, At approximately 11:22 a.m. on November 7  2003  Employee #1 was coiling a  0.375 in. nylon tag-line rope around the fingers of his right hand when the  wheel of the boom fork rolled over the end of the line  pulling it suddenly  tight and severing four fingers of the hand. It appears that while walking  next to a boom fork with a skid box attached  Employee #1 was attending a  tag-line to ensure that the skid box traveled smoothly. The injured EE  sustained an amputation injury. The fingers were saved and he was transported  immediately to Davies Medical Center for reattachment surgery.                  
201181443, Finger Caught Between Sheave And Cable And Amputated ," At approximately 1:00 p.m. on November 5  2002  four employees were hoisting  steel angles using an electric winch and pulleys. The angles were 6 in. by 6  in. by .75 in. They were using scaffolding on the exterior of the building and  had set up a winch to raise the angles. They were hoisting the angles between  the scaffolding and the exterior of the building  then passing the angles  through the window. Two coworkers were working on the ground  one operating  the winch. The employee and another coworker were working from the  scaffolding. No tag line was being used to control the load and the hoist  cables became tangled when they started to hoist the angle. The employee  climbed up the scaffold to the last stage to untangle the cables. He grabbed  the hoist cable to twist it with his hand  and called out ""OK "". The coworker  on the ground started the winch again while the employee continued to guide  the load by grabbing the hoist cable. His finger got caught between the sheave  and the cable and a portion of his right index finger tip was amputated. He  was moved to San Francisco General Hospital for treatment.                      "
305028011, Employee Killed When Crushed By Load Of Pipe , On June 21  2002  Employee #1 was standing on the tailgate of a pick-up truck  holding a pipe tagline during an operation to load 2-ft by 70-ft steel pipes  onto a truck trailer. As the last pipe was being loaded  the remaining pipes  shifted and rolled off the trailer  crushing Employee #1  and killing him.      
201502218, Employee Injured In Fall , At approximately 8:00 a.m. on October 24  2000  Employee #1 was working on a  bolt up crew. Employee #1 was bolting up steel beams when he ran out of bolts   stood up and traveled on the top of building steel to get some more. As  Employee #1 traveled across the steel  the employer was hoisting a load of 14  sheets of 3-ft-by-25-ft steel pan deck weighing about 2500 pounds. The pan  deck was not provided with a tagline to control the load. As the load rotated   the employer did not sound a horn  whistle  or use any other device to warn  employees of the approaching load. The unrestrained load rotated into the  occupied working space  striking Employee #1 in the back. This blow caused  Employee #1 to lose his balance and fall. Employee #1 fell 13.5 ft striking a  level of decking and steel  and then fell off the leading edge of that level  an additional 12.5 ft to the steel deck. Employee #1 was seriously injured and  hospitalized as a result of the incident.                                       
201082765, Employee'S Foot Injured When Backed Over By Crane , On October 19  2000  Employee #1  a construction worker  was stabilizing a  precast concrete wall panel as a crane operator  who worked for another  company  was maneuvering it into position. During the process  the panel  apparently shifted and Employee #1 lost his balance  resulting in the crane  operator backing up over his foot. He sustained serious injuries and was  hospitalized for approximately 19 days. Employee #1  who had over 13 years of  experience with the employer  requested not to be interviewed for this report.  The crane was certified and the operator was well trained. The employer was  cited for general violations of T8CCR 4991(a)  controlling the crane so as to  avoid collision with persons  and T8CCR 4993(b)  tag or restraint lines shall  be used where rotation of the load is hazardous.                                
812685, One Killed  One Injured When Traffic Light Unit Falls , Employees #1 and #2 were on an eight-person crew that was installing a traffic  signal light with a cross-arm extending over a traffic island. The unit was  lifted into position using the boom of a digger truck  and four employees were  holding tag guide lines at the outer end of the cross-arm as it was raised.  The load line broke  and the traffic light unit fell  striking Employees #1  and #2. Employee #1 was killed and Employee #2 sustained injuries that  required hospitalization.                                                       
200551505, Employee Injured When Struck By Pipe  Dies Of Embolism , On August 10  2000  Employee #1 was part of a highway crew installing lengths  of 54 in. diameter by 8 ft long concrete drain pipe. They were using a John  Deere trackhoe  model 792  to lift the 3 900 lb pipe joints into place so that  they could be lined up for the culvert. Each joint was secured by a shackle to  the boom of the trackhoe and the end of a 3/4 in. steel cable was inserted in  a hole on top of the pipe and a steel pin was run through the cable inside the  pipe to secure the pipe to the load line. The pipe was then balanced  approximately in the middle as it was lifted. On August 9  the crew had used  this same procedure to set approximately 22 pipe joints. As the crew set the  second joint on August 10  a coworker had his hand resting on one end of the  pipe while Employee #1 was standing at the other end of the pipe. As the pipe  was being manually maneuvered by the coworker  Employee #1 moved toward the  pipe and was struck in the right hip by the end of the pipe joint. He fell  down  but got back up and walked a few steps before he fell again. Employee #1  was transported to a nearby hospital and then transferred to a facility in  Vicksburg  MS  where he underwent surgery to repair a lacerated femoral  artery. He remained in the hospital and appeared to be recovering until he  suffered a massive embolism on August 24  2000  and died. No tag lines were  being used to help maneuver the pipe and prevent unnecessary movement.          
200850865, Employee Killed In Fall From Roof When Hoist Overturns , At approximately 1:20 p.m. on July 13  1999  Employee #1 was using a hoist to  lower roofing materials to the street when the hoist arm was pulled to the  north by the tag line. The counterweights were unable to hold the hoist down   and it tipped toward the street as Employee #1 was guiding the load down.

200651628, Employee Is Electrocuted On Transmission Tower , On September 19  2009  several crews from MJ Electric were nearing completion  of a new section of transmission line  which was to replace an existing  energized section. Power was to be switched over to the new section about  noon. At about 10:30 a.m.  Employee #1  an MJ line crew foreman who was to be  in charge of dropping the line for the existing section  received direction on  the afternoon's project from the project superintendent. The power switch-over  was discussed at this meeting as well as the day prior. They returned to the  location where Employee #1's crew was still working on the new installation.  They worked here for a while before Employee #1 told crew members that he was  going out to look at the lines and possibly do some administrative work.  Shortly after that  an outage on the existing line section was reported by the  power company to MJ's general foreman  who reported this to the  superintendent. They both checked their site preparation crew members because  it was clear to the line crew that they were not to be working on the live  existing lines until given authorization from the General Foreman  who would  first receive clearance from the power company and certify that the circuit  was deenergized. After accounting for crews they thought were in the vicinity  of the live lines  the general foreman and the superintendent directed the  power company to restore power to the existing lines. Very shortly after this   an ATV rider discovered Employee #1 burning in a transmission tower  approximately 45 ft above the ground. The rider used Employee #1's radio to  notify the company of his discovery. The general foreman directed the power  company to shut down the power and summoned emergency responders. Numerous MJ  crews and personnel traveled to the scene to assist. Two of the first linemen  to arrive found Employee #1 belted to a leg of the tower just below the lowest  supporting arm of the power lines  trying to release his belt. The two linemen  climbed the tower without direction and assisted Employee #1 to the ground. He  was still conscious  but his body and clothing were badly burned. Employee #1  was transported to a local hospital  and then airlifted to a regional burn  center  where he died three days later. It is unknown why he was on the tower  and why he was there alone. Employee #1 was wearing a hard hat  leather work  gloves  fire resistant tee shirt  safety glasses  safety boots  and a  positioning belt. He had a screwdriver but no hot stick or voltage detector.

14265235, Employee Killed In Fall Through Floor Opening , At 3:30 p.m. on April 10  1985  Employee #1 was using a pneumatic chipping gun  to trim brick around a window opening. He stepped back and tripped on a brick   falling through an unguarded floor opening to the basement level. Employee  #1was killed.                                                                   
201560315, Employee Injured In Fall From Unsecured Trough , On November 17  1999  Employee #1 and another employee were installing a  trough system in the interior of the water treatment containment. The  containment was constructed of concrete and formed in the shape of a large  cylinder. The trough system was constructed of steel and rested on 5.75 ft  steel supports above the bottom interior surface of the containment. The steel  supports were mounted to the surface of the concrete containment with 6 in.  bolts and epoxy adhesive. The trough system was designed to transport the flow  of water to the containment. The employees were in the process of placing the  trough onto the supports  and tack weld an uneven section of trough to a  neighboring section of trough. It was standard procedure for an employee to  stand on a trough section which was uneven in order to level it with the  neighboring trough system  while another employee tack welded the two troughs  systems together. This procedure exposed Employee #1 to a fall of 5.75 ft. The  employer had written fall protection policy that requires employees to be tied  off when working at a level of 6 ft or higher. As Employee #1 stood upon the  uneven trough  a top bolt to a steel support loosened and pulled out allowing  another section of the trough to fall. The steel support that fell was roughly  20 ft away from where he was standing. The trough did not completely sever  from all of its supports because the employer had secured the trough with  brackets in order to prevent this from occurring. However  the fall of the far  end of the trough system (which was the system they were attempting to level)  causing the rest of the trough system to twist. This twisting action knocked  Employee #1 off from where he was positioned. He fell 5.75 ft onto the  concrete below striking his head on its surface. The force of the impact on  his cerebrum caused hemorrhaging  which was not fatal. He was hospitalized for  hematoma (the collection of blood resulting from hemorrhaging) and received  surgical and postoperative treatment.                                           
170751598, Employee Injured By Falling Brick Wall , Three employees from Nitterhouse Concrete Products were working on the floor  of the sixth story of a six story steel frame  masonry block with brick  veneer  residential facility.

He had to go down and get a  reducer. As Employee #1 approached the attic opening  he had one foot on the  truss and the other one on a 2 by 4 wooden block. The wooden block gave way   causing Employee #1 to fall 9 ft onto the cement floor. Employee #1 fractured  his back and was taken to Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage   California  where he was hospitalized for 6 days. Employee #1 was not wearing  personal fall protection when he fell. The coworker was not injured. The  employer is a HVAC contractor.                                                  
901884, Employee Falls To His Death , At approximately 1:00 p.m. on October 24  2002  an employee working alone   removing improperly located floor trusses for the fourth floor of an apartment  building under construction. The building is of wooden construction and the  fourth floor trusses are 2-ft by 4-ft chord and web trusses  18 inch in the  vertical dimension. The employee lost his balance falling approximately 28 ft  to the ground. The employee was transported to a local hospital where he later  died of his injuries.                                                           
201024791, Worker Falls From Roof And Sustains Multiple Fractures , On May 15  2013  a roofer  employed by Armstrong Installation Service dba  Armstrong Paint  was constructing a new roof on an existing residential  structure. He was on the roof and using a leaf blower. He slipped and fell to  the ground below  a distance of approximately 32 feet. He was transported to  the hospital  admitted  and treated for fractured ribs and vertebrae. The  employer reported to Cal/OSHA's Santa Rosa District office on May 15  2013.  The subsequent investigation determined that Employee #1 was not using fall  protection.                                                                     
201129624, Employee Fractures Back In Fall From Third Floor , At approximately 10:00 a.m. on March 4  2013  Employee #1 was working on a  beam on the third floor of the building at a construction site. A coworker was  standing on the third level waiting for the employee to pick up the beam so he  could hold the other end and move to attach the beam to a wall. Employee #1  and the coworker were not wearing fall protection. As Employee #1 bent down to  grab the beam using the claw of his hammer  he lost his balance and fell to  the second floor  a fall height of 12 feet and 11 inches. Employee #1 was  taken to Stanford Hospital  where he was hospitalized for eight days and  treated for vertebral fracture. After his discharge from the hospital   Employee #1 was transferred to a rehabilitation facility  where he stayed for  seven days.                                                                     
201523081, Employee'S Finger Amputated By Saw When Wood Kicks Back , On August 17  2007  Employee #1 was ripping molding for a mantle in the family  room because the existing mantle and molding were not to the owner's liking.  He needed to rip the molding in half  which required that he stand up the  crown molding and raise the blade very high. The approximately 5 ft long  molding was difficult to cut. He was feeding the piece and the cut sections  were getting longer and started to vibrate. To stop the wood from shaking  he  passed his left hand over the blade to support the piece after the blade had  gone through it. The wood unexpectantly kicked back and the saw amputated his  fourth finger and the tip of another finger. There was no guard on the saw.  Employee #1 later stated that it was common practice in the trade not to use  the guard. The saw had been used by coworkers at the site that day.             
202447413, Employee Injured When Crushed By Collapsing Concrete Wall , At approximately 7:15 a.m. on August 9  2007  Employee #1 and a coworker were  stripping the interior form work of a 15 ft long by 8 ft deep by 3 ft wide by  8 in. thick  type G-2 drainage inlet structure. They were doing this while the  cement slurry backfill was being poured between the excavation wall and the  north wall of the inlet structure. Two trucks  each carrying 10 cubic yards of  the slurry  had already poured in their contents. When the third truck pour  was in progress  the north wall developed vertical cracks and pushed toward  the south wall of the inlet structure  crushing Employee #1 against the south  wall. He sustained numerous bodily injuries. The coworker was able to climb  out safely.                                                                     
200624088, Employee Killed When Struck By Collapsing Pile Of Soil , During the morning of August 18  2006  Employee #1 was using a Caterpillar  D4HXL Series III diesel bulldozer to grade a residential lot for construction  of a single-family home. As he was working  an adjacent pile of topsoil  apparently collapsed on top of him. Employee #1 suffered blunt force trauma  injuries and was killed. He was working alone and there were no witnesses. At  approximately 11:15 a.m.  another work found Employee #1 on the right track of  the bulldozer.                                                                  
201203213, Employee Injured In Trench Cave, On May 22  2006  Employees #1 and a coworker were installing a 10 in. diameter  sewer line in an approximately 36 in. wide by 7 ft 3 in. deep trench. They  finished putting in the first section of pipe and tamped it in with a  mechanical tamper. The employees then had the excavator dig out for the next  length  put bedding rock down  and install the second section of pipe in the  trench. They were using a laser to make sure it was on grade when a coworker  standing near the trench saw the north wall start to move and shouted out a  warning. The wall caved in on them  completely covering the coworker and  burying Employeee #1 up to his waist. Both workers were successfully  extricated. Employee #1 suffered a cracked rib and bruised shoulder where he  was struck by a large clod of the clay dirt. The coworker also suffered a  cracked rib  as well as a small puncture to his lung  which quickly closed.  Both employees returned to work within seven work days. The trench had been  dug in clay soil  but a natural gas line had been installed 16 to 18 in. to  the north and about 48 to 52 in. deep. This left an approximately 12 in. wide  clay wall of original material between the two excavations  which is what had  toppled into Employee #1's trench. In addition  the trench in which the pipe  was being installed was not shored or otherwise protected against cave-ins.  There had been heavy rains in the area during the night before the accident.    
201794542, Employee Crushed In Trench Collapse ," At approximately 9:30 a.m. on September 13  2001  Employee #1 was using a  shovel to square off the sides of a trench that was 45 inches wide and 4 feet  deep in a class ""C"" sandy soil. One employee was operating a Ramax multi-quip  compactor machine  having Serial Number 31382  a few feet from Employee #1.  The Ramax compactor was a rental from Sunstate Equipment Company. A wall fence  measuring 36 feet in length and 98 inches high from the bottom of the trench  to the top of the wall was on the South side of the trench. The bottom of the  trench was even with the bottom of the wall foundation. The stability of the  wall was endangered by the excavation and compaction operations. Employee #1's  employer did not provide a support system  such as bracing  shoring or  underpinning  to protect employees. The wall collapsed  pinning two employees   including Employee #1  between the wall and the side of the trench. The  position of the Ramax compactor in the trench and some blocks that became  wedged between the collapsed wall and top of the trench kept the wall from  fatally crushing the two employees. The other employee received minor  injuries. Employee #1 spent six days in Saint Francis hospital for broken ribs  and had a ruptured spleen removed.                                              "
170672570, Employee Killed In Fall From Concrete Forms , A large culvert was being built for new highway construction. Employee #1 and  three coworkers were working at 10 to 12 ft on top of concrete forms without  fall protection. Two coworkers were dumping a bucket of concrete while  Employee #1 was manipulating a concrete vibrator. The other coworker was doing  finishing work. The back form wall was consistently 12 ft high and the inside  wall was 12 ft half the distance and then dropped to 10 ft in height. A  temporary block measuring 2 ft by 2 ft was used as a leveler between the 12 ft  and 10 ft sections of the walls in order to stabilize the concrete chute.  According to the coworkers  Employee #1 apparently fell when he either  inadvertently backed from the upper level to the lower or slipped on the  non-stationary block. Employee #1 died.                                         
14518211, Employee Crushed When Vibrating Roller Overturned Onto Him , AT 12:55 PM ON OCTOBER 1  1986  EMPLOYEE #1 WAS USING A VIBRATING ROLLER  MACHINE TO COMPACT SOIL AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE. WHILE HE WAS MANUEVERING THE  ROLLER ON THE 45 DEGREE SLOPE HE DROVE TOO CLOSE TO THE EDGE AND FLIPPED OVER.  EMPLOYEE #1 JUMPED OFF THE MACHINE TO THE DOWNHILL SIDE  BUT WAS UNABLE TO  AVOID THE ROLLER. IT FELL ON TOP OF HIM  CRUSHING HIM TO DEATH.                 
14483085, Crushed By Roller Vibrator That Tipped And Rolled Over , Employee #1 was moving a vibrator roller (Hyster) off the main road to a side  road. It was assumed that he did this to let a dump truck pass on the main  road. Employee #1 was sitting on the Hyster (#6620B). The road where he pulled  the roller onto was approximately 10 feet wide. Apparently  he came too close  to the edge of the road  and the roller tipped over and rolled 12 feet down a  bank that had a 40- to 45-degree angle from the horizontal. The employee was  killed. There were no witnesses to the accident.                                
200451870, Employee Electrocuted While Splicing Together Power Line , On July 12  2005  Employee #1 was part of a three-man crew that was  re-establishing electrical service to customers in the Flomaton  AL  area  following power outages caused by Hurricane Dennis. At the time of the  accident  he was in an insulated aerial lift bucket  splicing together a  12-kilovolt electrical line. The two conductor ends were pulled together and  held in position with a manual come-along (bulldog) tool. When Employee #1 was  almost done connecting the two ends of the line  he grasped both ends to  complete the splice. At that time. the line became energized and Employee #1  was electrocuted. He was not wearing rubber gloves. The most likely source of  the electrical energy was a portable generator connected to a nearby house  circuit box  which may have caused a backfeed into the conductor.               
201330776, Employee Killed When Power Backfed Through Generator , On November 6  2004  Employee #1 was electrocuted when a 480 volt service was  backfed through an emergency generator.                                         
201166238, Employee Injured By Electric Shock From Contact With Busbar , At approximately 9:15 a.m. on July 19  2004  Employee #1  an electrician's  helper  was helping to rewire an old high-rise office building in Los Angeles   CA. He applied fire stop to the electrical conduits in the walls on the first  floor. The conduits brought wires up from the basement  where high-voltage  power lines entered the building  and reduced the voltage to 120/240 volts.  Employee #1 then remembered a 1 1/2 in. conduit inside one of the service  cabinets  which was on the ground floor. The conduit needed a strap installed  before more power lines could be brought up from the basement. Employee #1  removed two corner screws in the cabinet's door so he could open it and he was  leaning forward over the splash apron to access the conduit when his head  contacted a 120-volt busbar. He received an electric shock and was rendered  unconscious. A coworker started CPR and revived him. Employee #1 sustained  small burns on the bottom of his right arm and left thumb  which provided  paths for the electricity  and a severe burn on the right front part of his  skull. All the service cabinets on the first floor were de-energized except  for one that was backfed to supply 120 volts for lighting the building. The  cabinet Employee #1 opened had a lockout on the breaker that was accessible  from outside the cabinet  However  when he removed the corner screws  the lock  stayed on the breaker as the door opened. The busbars inside the cabinet were  also backfed and  had the breaker been closed  an explosion would have  occurred in the basement.                                                       
200821106, Electric Shock & Burn , The employee was stripping the insulation from a conductor as he was rewiring  some equipment. He received an electric shock and sustained minor burns on his  thumb. He had followed lockout procedures. However  postaccident investigation  by the company discovered a jumper in the control box. The jumper should have  been removed before the machine left the factory. When another unit was  energized  voltage fed back through the jumper  energizing the machine's  wiring. (The wiring was deenergized at the time the machine was locked out.)    
200521714, Electric Shock , A journeyman power line worker was removing a pole-mounted 7200/240-volt  transformer. He removed and coiled the jumper to primary-side phase conductor.  He then operated what he thought was the disconnect switch for the secondary.  He removed his rubber insulating gloves and placed his hands on the ungrounded  primary terminal on the transformer. The switch did not control the secondary   and the primary terminal was apparently energized by backfeed through the  transformer. The employee was electrocuted. He had entry and exit burns on his  hands and stomach.                                                              
524371, Electric Shock , Two employees were in an aerial lift  connecting a light that was installed  next to a trailer. One of them had disconnected the jumper from the primary  side of a transformer  leaving the conductor attached to the hot stick.  However  he did not remove the jumper from the secondary of the transformer.  When he touched the end of the disconnected jumper  he received an electric  shock from voltage backfeed. He was hospitalized for his injury. (The other  employee in the aerial lift was not injured.)                                   
14291710, Electric Shock , An electrical supervisor was installing a junction box about 3 meters (10  feet) above the ground. The box contained a neutral conductor that the  employee thought was deenergized. However  this conductor was energized by  another circuit remote from the work area. The neutral conductor in turn  energized a conduit that the supervisor was holding onto. He received an  electric shock and fell to the ground. The supervisor was hospitalized for his  injuries.

The contractor was installing handicap access  ramps  and was conducting asphalt-patching activities. The temperature was  approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Employee #1 was assigned the job of  using a shovel to prepare the site for asphalt pouring. Employee #1 and his  coworkers completed asphalt-paving activities  and began cleaning up the  worksite. Coworker #1 noticed that Employee #1 was walking sluggishly  and  told Employee #1 to go and sit in the pickup truck. Employee #1 sat in the  idling pickup truck with the air conditioning running  and Coworker #1 brought  Employee #1 a sports drink and some fruit. Coworker #2 was working a short  distance away and he saw Employee #1 get out of the truck and walk towards  him. Coworkers #1 and #2 walked to the truck at this time and they both told  Employee #1 that they were almost finished and would be leaving soon.  Coworkers #1 and #2 walked away  and Employee #1 collapsed. Coworkers #1 and  #2 ran to Employee #1 to help and Coworker #1 called Emergency Services.  Coworker #1 placed ice on Employee #1  who began to speak incoherently and  vomited. Employee #1 then became nonresponsive and Emergency Services were  called again. Paramedics arrived and transported Employee #1 to Eisenhower  Medical Center in Rancho Mirage  CA. Employee #1 was pronounced dead at 1:43  p.m. The cause of death was determined by the coroner to be not heat-related;  therefore  this incident is classified as nonoccupational. The actual cause of  death was not specified. No violations of the California Code of Regulations  Title 8 were determined to have contributed to the employee's death.

201262938, Employer Is Injured In Fall From Roof ," At approximately 1:00 p.m. on March 10  2011  an employer  a sole proprietor   and his employee were going to inspect and patch a low-slope (flat) roof on a  one-story  existing commercial building. The employer and employee brought  materials up to the roof to make repairs. The employer and employee cleared  gravel from several locations on the roof. During this process  the employer  determined that the damage was too extensive to repair and the roof needed to  be replaced. No repair work was performed on the roof. The employer contacted  the building owner to inform him of his assessment  and the building owner  requested that the employer provide a cost estimate for replacement. The  employer and the employee then measured the roof. During the final  measurement  from west to east  the employer was walking backward. He tripped  over the parapet wall  approximately eight inches wide and seven inches high   and fell to the ground. The employer sustained six broken ribs and a punctured  lung. He was transported to Lutheran General Hospital  in Park Ridge   Illinois  for treatment and hospitalization. An emergency responder spoke with  the employee who stated that he had informed the employer that he was ""getting  close to the roof edge and to be careful"". The distance from the top of the  parapet wall to the ground was approximately 18.6 feet. A witness loading a  truck across the street stated that he saw the employer and employee on the  roof  and when he turned back  he saw the employer on the ground.

The firm was part of the project of expanding  the Loker Student Union building at California State University  Dominguez  Hills  Carson Campus (CSUDH  Carson). The company was excavating and pouring  concrete for the entire building. A concrete roof structure 120 ft wide and 13  ft tall had been poured earlier. It was provided with a guardrail or handrail  at a height of 13 ft to provide fall protection. From the edge of that  structure  30-in. by 30-in. concrete beams had been poured as well. Next to  those beams  0.63-in.-thick drywall boards had been placed horizontally  flush  with the top surfaces of the beams  to prevent dust in the construction area  from entering the area underneath  which was not part of the construction  activities. After Employee #1 and some workers had completed work on the roof  structure  they were advised by a supervisor to wait on the structure  inside  the peripheral handrail area. Employee #1 was holding a tube that was to be  used for pouring concrete on a part on the structure attached to the other end  of one of the beams.

Employee #1 was up on the roof. He stated that he was standing on a 6-foot  (1.8-meter) stepladder. It had been placed on the roof. The roof had a  slightly sloped and uneven surface  as it was covered with curved ceramic  tiles. Employee #1 stated that he was using this stepladder as a single  ladder. That is  he was using it without opening it. Rather than have all four  of the ladder's feet on the surface of the roof  he had only two of the  ladder's feet on the roof. The top of the ladder was leaning against a wall.  Employee #1 stated that the ladder was accordingly not secure. While Employee  #1 was on the ladder  it started slipping off the roof. Employee #1 fell off  the roof. As he fell  his body struck a stucco column with a 2-foot by 2-foot  (0.6-meter by 0.6-meter) surface  which was about 10 feet (3 meters) below the  roof. He then bounced to the stairways below the stucco column  where he hit  his head on the metal railing of stairways. He landed on the sidewalk and  finally stopped falling. The total fall distance from the roof to the ground  was about 19 feet (5.8 meters). Employee #1 suffered a laceration to his head  and abrasions to his left side of the body.
